Arlequin 3 introduces a completely new graphical interface written in C++, a more robust semantic analysis of input fi les, and two new methods: a Bayesian estimation of gametic phase from multi-locus genotypes, and an estimation of the parameters of an instantaneous spatial expansion from DNA sequence polymorphism. Arlequin can handle several data types like DNA sequences, microsatellite data, or standard multi-locus genotypes.

Our studies of graphene - a single atomic layer of carbon - have revealed a variety of unusual phenomena characteristic of two-dimensional (2D) Dirac fermions. In particular, we have observed that a) the integer quantum Hall effect in graphene is anomalous in that it occurs at half-integer filling factors; b) graphene's conductivity never falls below a minimum value corresponding to the conductance quantum e^2/h, even when carrier concentrations tend to zero; c) the cyclotron mass m of massless carriers with energy E in graphene is described by equation E =mc*^2; and d) Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in graphene exhibit a phase shift of pi due to Berry's phase.",

Once tumor development begins, immune cells that infiltrate and subsequently reside within neoplastic microenvironments regulate paracrine pathways in the tissue that foster neoplastic cell survival and proliferation, as well as regulating vascular cells, mesenchymal support cells, and other immune cells to similarly support neoplastic progression and tumor development. We now appreciate that immune microenvironments in solid tumors are targets for anticancer therapy, whereby therapeutics aim to neutralize their tumor-promoting activities, which is coincident with bolstering their embedded activities to foster T cell mobilization and cytotoxic functions through enhanced recognition of tumor-specific antigens. The key leukocytes that contribute to acute versus chronic inflammation in cancer, as well as the mechanisms by which they do so are subjects of the ongoing investigations. This article outlines differences between acute and chronic inflammation in the context of cancer, how each state arises, and how each can be manipulated for development of new cancer therapeutics.",

Therefore, the effect of such factors on risk of coronary heart disease in most regions of the world is unknown. Methods We established a standardised case-control study of acute myocardial infarction in 52 countries, representing every inhabited continent. 15 152 cases and 14 820 controls were enrolled. The relation of smoking, history of hypertension or diabetes, waist/hip ratio, dietary patterns, physical activity, consumption of alcohol, blood apolipoproteins (Apo), and psychosocial factors to myocardial infarction are reported here. Odds ratios and their 99% CIs for the association of risk factors to myocardial infarction and their population attributable risks (PAR) were calculated. Findings Smoking (odds ratio 2\u00b787 for current vs never, PAR 35\u00b77% for current and former vs never), raised ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (3\u00b725 for top vs lowest quintile, PAR 49\u00b72% for top four quintiles vs lowest quintile), history of hypertension (1\u00b791, PAR 17\u00b79%), diabetes (2\u00b737, PAR 9\u00b79%), abdominal obesity (1\u00b712 for top vs lowest tertile and 1\u00b762 for middle vs lowest tertile, PAR 20\u00b71% for top two tertiles vs lowest tertile), psychosocial factors (2\u00b767, PAR 32\u00b75%), daily consumption of fruits and vegetables (0\u00b770, PAR 13\u00b77% for lack of daily consumption), regular alcohol consumption (0\u00b791, PAR 6\u00b77%), and regular physical activity (0\u00b786, PAR 12\u00b72%), were all significantly related to acute myocardial infarction (p<0\u00b70001 for all risk factors and p=0\u00b703 for alcohol). These associations were noted in men and women, old and young, and in all regions of the world. Collectively, these nine risk factors accounted for 90% of the PAR in men and 94% in women. Interpretation Abnormal lipids, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors, consumption of fruits, vegetables, and alcohol, and regular physical activity account for most of the risk of myocardial infarction worldwide in both sexes and at all ages in all regions. This finding suggests that approaches to prevention can be based on similar principles worldwide and have the potential to prevent most premature cases of myocardial infarction.",

Exceptions are found in the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone of several species that have been shown to generate new neurons well into the postnatal and adult period 1\u20106 . Granule neurons are generated throughout life from a population of continuously dividing progenitor cells residing in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in the rodent brain 5 . \u2018Newborn\u2019 neurons generated from these progenitor cells migrate into the granule cell layer, differentiate, extend axons and express neuronal marker proteins 7\u201010 .

Postmortem tissue from the hippocampus and the subventricular zone of caudate nucleus was obtained from cancer patients (n = 5) who received one intravenous infusion (250 mg; 2.5 mg/ml, 100 ml) of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for diagnostic purposes 11 .

            "abstract": "Summary Background Although more than 80% of the global burden of cardiovascular disease occurs in low-income and middle-income countries, knowledge of the importance of risk factors is largely derived from developed countries. Therefore, the effect of such factors on risk of coronary heart disease in most regions of the world is unknown. Methods We established a standardised case-control study of acute myocardial infarction in 52 countries, representing every inhabited continent. 15 152 cases and 14 820 controls were enrolled. The relation of smoking, history of hypertension or diabetes, waist/hip ratio, dietary patterns, physical activity, consumption of alcohol, blood apolipoproteins (Apo), and psychosocial factors to myocardial infarction are reported here. Odds ratios and their 99% CIs for the association of risk factors to myocardial infarction and their population attributable risks (PAR) were calculated. Findings Smoking (odds ratio 2\u00b787 for current vs never, PAR 35\u00b77% for current and former vs never), raised ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (3\u00b725 for top vs lowest quintile, PAR 49\u00b72% for top four quintiles vs lowest quintile), history of hypertension (1\u00b791, PAR 17\u00b79%), diabetes (2\u00b737, PAR 9\u00b79%), abdominal obesity (1\u00b712 for top vs lowest tertile and 1\u00b762 for middle vs lowest tertile, PAR 20\u00b71% for top two tertiles vs lowest tertile), psychosocial factors (2\u00b767, PAR 32\u00b75%), daily consumption of fruits and vegetables (0\u00b770, PAR 13\u00b77% for lack of daily consumption), regular alcohol consumption (0\u00b791, PAR 6\u00b77%), and regular physical activity (0\u00b786, PAR 12\u00b72%), were all significantly related to acute myocardial infarction (p<0\u00b70001 for all risk factors and p=0\u00b703 for alcohol). These associations were noted in men and women, old and young, and in all regions of the world. Collectively, these nine risk factors accounted for 90% of the PAR in men and 94% in women. Interpretation Abnormal lipids, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors, consumption of fruits, vegetables, and alcohol, and regular physical activity account for most of the risk of myocardial infarction worldwide in both sexes and at all ages in all regions. This finding suggests that approaches to prevention can be based on similar principles worldwide and have the potential to prevent most premature cases of myocardial infarction.",

            "abstract": "Loss of neurons is thought to be irreversible in the adult human brain, because dying neurons cannot be replaced. This inability to generate replacement cells is thought to be an important cause of neurological disease and impairment. In most brain regions, the generation of neurons is generally confined to a discrete developmental period. Exceptions are found in the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone of several species that have been shown to generate new neurons well into the postnatal and adult period 1\u20106 . Granule neurons are generated throughout life from a population of continuously dividing progenitor cells residing in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in the rodent brain 5 . \u2018Newborn\u2019 neurons generated from these progenitor cells migrate into the granule cell layer, differentiate, extend axons and express neuronal marker proteins 7\u201010 . We examined whether progenitor cells reside in the adult human hippocampus and whether new neurons are born within the dentate gyrus of the adult human brain. Postmortem tissue from the hippocampus and the subventricular zone of caudate nucleus was obtained from cancer patients (n = 5) who received one intravenous infusion (250 mg; 2.5 mg/ml, 100 ml) of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for diagnostic purposes 11 . One patient diagnosed with a similar type and location of cancer, but without BrdU treatment, was included as a control. A thymidine analog, BrdU is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells and can be detected immunohistochemically in their progeny 5,12,13 .",

            "abstract": "Abstract#R##N##R##N#A recent report that 93 per cent of invasive cervical cancers worldwide contain human papillomavirus (HPV) may be an underestimate, due to sample inadequacy or integration events affecting the HPV L1 gene, which is the target of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test which was used. The formerly HPV-negative cases from this study have therefore been reanalysed for HPV serum antibodies and HPV DNA. Serology for HPV 16 VLPs, E6, and E7 antibodies was performed on 49 of the 66 cases which were HPV-negative and a sample of 48 of the 866 cases which were HPV-positive in the original study. Moreover, 55 of the 66 formerly HPV-negative biopsies were also reanalysed by a sandwich procedure in which the outer sections in a series of sections are used for histological review, while the inner sections are assayed by three different HPV PCR assays targeting different open reading frames (ORFs). No significant difference was found in serology for HPV 16 proteins between the cases that were originally HPV PCR-negative and -positive. Type-specific E7 PCR for 14 high-risk HPV types detected HPV DNA in 38 (69 per cent) of the 55 originally HPV-negative and amplifiable specimens. The HPV types detected were 16, 18, 31, 33, 39, 45, 52, and 58. Two (4 per cent) additional cases were only HPV DNA-positive by E1 and/or L1 consensus PCR. Histological analysis of the 55 specimens revealed that 21 were qualitatively inadequate. Only two of the 34 adequate samples were HPV-negative on all PCR tests, as against 13 of the 21 that were inadequate ( p< 0\u00b7001). Combining the data from this and the previous study and excluding inadequate specimens, the worldwide HPV prevalence in cervical carcinomas is 99\u00b77 per cent. The presence of HPV in virtually all cervical cancers implies the highest worldwide attributable fraction so far reported for a specific cause of any major human cancer. The extreme rarity of HPV-negative cancers reinforces the rationale for HPV testing in addition to, or even instead of, cervical cytology in routine cervical screening.

            "abstract": "Background Quinquennial overviews (1985-2000) of the randomised trials in early breast cancer have assessed the 5-year and 10-year effects of various systemic adjuvant therapies on breast cancer recurrence and survival. Here, we report the 10-year and 15-year effects. Methods Collaborative meta-analyses were undertaken of 194 unconfounded randomised trials of adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy that began by 1995. Many trials involved CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil), anthracycline-based combinations such as FAC (fluorouracil, doxombicin, cyclophosphamide) or FEC (fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide), tamoxifen, or ovarian suppression: none involved taxanes, trastuzumab, raloxifene, or modem aromatase inhibitors. Findings Allocation to about 6 months of anthracycline-based polychemotherapy (eg, with FAC or FEC) reduces the annual breast cancer death rate by about 38% (SE 5) for women younger than 50 years of age when diagnosed and by about 20% (SE 4) for those of age 50-69 years when diagnosed, largely irrespective of the use of tamoxifen and of oestrogen receptor (ER) status, nodal status, or other tumour characteristics. Such regimens are significantly (2p=0 . 0001 for recurrence, 2p<0 . 00001 for breast cancer mortality) more effective than CMF chemotherapy. Few women of age 70 years or older entered these chemotherapy trials. For ER-positive disease only, allocation to about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen reduces the annual breast cancer death rate by 31% (SE 3), largely irrespective of the use of chemotherapy and of age (<50, 50-69, G 70 years), progesterone receptor status, or other tumour characteristics. 5 years is significantly (2p<0 . 00001 for recurrence, 2p=0 . 01 for breast cancer mortality) more effective than just 1-2 years of tamoxifen. For ER-positive tumours, the annual breast cancer mortality rates are similar during years 0-4 and 5-14, as are the proportional reductions in them by 5 years of tamoxifen, so the cumulative reduction in mortality is more than twice as big at 15 years as at 5 years after diagnosis. These results combine six meta-analyses: anthracycline-based versus no chemotherapy (8000 women); CMF-based versus no chemotherapy (14 000); anthracycline-based versus CMF-based chemotherapy (14 000); about 5 years of tamoxifen versus none (15 000); about 1-2 years of tamoxifen versus none (33 000); and about 5 years versus 1-2 years of tamoxifen (18 000). Finally, allocation to ovarian ablation or suppression (8000 women) also significantly reduces breast cancer mortality, but appears to do so only in the absence of other systemic treatments. For middle-aged women with ER-positive disease (the commonest type of breast cancer), the breast cancer mortality rate throughout the next 15 years would be approximately halved by 6 months of anthracycline-based chemotherapy (with a combination such as FAC or FEC) followed by 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. For, if mortality reductions of 38% (age <50 years) and 20% (age 50-69 years) from such chemotherapy were followed by a further reduction of 31% from tamoxifen in the risks that remain, the final mortality reductions would be 57% and 45%, respectively (and, the trial results could well have been somewhat stronger if there had been full compliance with the allocated treatments). Overall survival would be comparably improved, since these treatments have relatively small effects on mortality from the aggregate of all other causes. Interpretation Some of the widely practicable adjuvant drug treatments that were being tested in the 1980s, which substantially reduced 5-year recurrence rates (but had somewhat less effect on 5-year mortality rates), also substantially reduce 15-year mortality rates. Further improvements in long-term survival could well be available from newer drugs, or better use of older drugs.",

            "abstract": "Like Drosophila Toll, human Toll is a type I transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain consisting of a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, and a cytoplasmic domain homologous to the cytoplasmic domain of the human interleukin (IL)-1 receptor. Both Drosophila Toll and the IL-1 receptor are known to signal through the NF-kB pathway 5-7 . We show that a constitutively active mutant of human Toll transfected into human cell lines can induce the activation of NF-kB and the expression of NF-kB-controlled genes for the inflammatory cyto- kines IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8, as well as the expression of the co- stimulatory molecule B7.1, which is required for the activation of naive T cells. The Toll protein controls dorsal-ventral patterning in Drosophila embryos and activates the transcription factor Dorsal upon binding to its ligand Spatzle 8 . In adult Drosophila, the Toll/Dorsal signalling pathway participates in an anti-fungal immune response 2 . Signal- ling through Toll parallels the signalling pathway induced by the IL- 1 receptor (IL-1R) in mammalian cells: IL-1R signals through the NF-kB pathway, and Dorsal and its inhibitor Cactus are homo- logous to NF-kB and I-kB proteins, respectively 5,6 . Moreover, the cytoplasmic domain of Drosophila Toll is homologous to the cytoplasmic domain of IL-1R (ref. 9). Remarkably, the tobacco- virus-resistance gene that encodes N-protein is also similar to Toll in that it contains both a Toll signalling domain and an LRR domain 10 . It thus appears that the immune-response system mediated by Toll represents an ancient host defence mechanism 6 (Fig. 1). To inves- tigate the possibility that this pathway has been retained in the immune system of vertebrates, we used sequence and pattern searches 11 of the expressed-sequence tag (EST) database at the fragment was used to probe northern blots containing poly(A) + RNA from several organs. Most organs expressed two mRNA species: one of ,5 kilobases (kb) was predominant in most tissues except peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL), and corresponded to the length of the cDNA that we cloned. The lower band was ,4 kb long and this band was predominant in the PBL. The 4-kb band was not detectable in kidney, and liver did not contain any mRNA at all (Fig. 3). We also tested different mouse and human cell lines for expression of hToll mRNA by using PCR with reverse transcription (RT-PCR). We found mRNA for hToll in monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, g/d T cells, Th1 and Th2 a/b T cells, a small intestinal epithelial cell line, and a B-cell line (data not shown). The hToll gene is expressed most strongly in spleen and PBL (Fig. 3); its expression in other tissues may be due to the presence of macrophages and dendritic cells, in which it could act as an early-warning system for infection. Alternatively, hToll may be widely expressed because hToll signals through the conserved NF-kB pathway (see below) and NF- kB is a ubiquitous transcription factor. To characterize hToll functions and see whether it can induce transcription of immune response genes like dToll, we generated a dominant-positive mutant of hToll because the natural ligand of hToll is unknown. To produce a constitutively active mutant of hToll, we made use of genetic information from dToll: analysis of ventra- lizing mutants in Drosophila embryos had identified the function of the ectodomain C-flanking cysteine-rich region in dToll 16 as control- ling the activity of dToll in signal transduction.

Methods In this multicenter, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 602 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who had not received previous systemic treatment to receive either sorafenib (at a dose of 400 mg twice daily) or placebo. Primary outcomes were overall survival and the time to symptomatic progression. Secondary outcomes included the time to radiologic progression and safety. Results At the second planned interim analysis, 321 deaths had occurred, and the study was stopped. Median overall survival was 10.7 months in the sorafenib group and 7.9 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the sorafenib group, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.55 to 0.87; P<0.001). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the median time to symptomatic progression (4.1 months vs. 4.9 months, respectively, P=0.77). The median time to radiologic progression was 5.5 months in the sorafenib group and 2.8 months in the placebo group (P<0.001). Seven patients in the sorafenib group (2%) and two patients in the placebo group (1%) had a partial response; no patients had a complete response.

The stability of these complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. In this paper we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems, but it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks. We find that scale-free networks, describing a number of systems, such as the World Wide Web, Internet, social networks or a cell, display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected by even unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price: these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks, i.e. to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play the most important role in assuring the network's connectivity.",

            "abstract": "Global and regional projections of mortality and burden of disease by cause for the years 2000 2010 and 2030 were published by Murray and Lopez in 1996 as part of the Global Burden of Disease project. These projections which are based on 1990 data continue to be widely quoted although they are substantially outdated; in particular they substantially underestimated the spread of HIV/AIDS. To address the widespread demand for information on likely future trends in global health and thereby to support international health policy and priority setting we have prepared new projections of mortality and burden of disease to 2030 starting from World Health Organization estimates of mortality and burden of disease for 2002. This paper describes the methods assumptions input data and results. Relatively simple models were used to project future health trends under three scenarios-- baseline optimistic and pessimistic--based largely on projections of economic and social development and using the historically observed relationships of these with cause-specific mortality rates. Data inputs have been updated to take account of the greater availability of death registration data and the latest available projections for HIV/AIDS income human capital tobacco smoking body mass index and other inputs. In all three scenarios there is a dramatic shift in the distribution of deaths from younger to older ages and from communicable maternal perinatal and nutritional causes to noncommunicable disease causes. The risk of death for children younger than 5 y is projected to fall by nearly 50% in the baseline scenario between 2002 and 2030. The proportion of deaths due to noncommunicable disease is projected to rise from 59% in 2002 to 69% in 2030. Global HIV/AIDS deaths are projected to rise from 2.8 million in 2002 to 6.5 million in 2030 under the baseline scenario which assumes coverage with antiretroviral drugs reaches 80% by 2012. Under the optimistic scenario which also assumes increased prevention activity HIV/AIDS deaths are projected to drop to 3.7 million in 2030. Total tobacco-attributable deaths are projected to rise from 5.4 million in 2005 to 6.4 million in 2015 and 8.3 million in 2030 under our baseline scenario. Tobacco is projected to kill 50% more people in 2015 than HIV/AIDS and to be responsible for 10% of all deaths globally. The three leading causes of burden of disease in 2030 are projected to include HIV/AIDS unipolar depressive disorders and ischaemic heart disease in the baseline and pessimistic scenarios. Road traffic accidents are the fourth leading cause in the baseline scenario and the third leading cause ahead of ischaemic heart disease in the optimistic scenario. Under the baseline scenario HIV/AIDS becomes the leading cause of burden of disease in middle- and low-income countries by 2015. These projections represent a set of three visions of the future for population health based on certain explicit assumptions. Despite the wide uncertainty ranges around future projections they enable us to appreciate better the implications for health and health policy of currently observed trends and the likely impact of fairly certain future trends such as the ageing of the population the continued spread of HIV/AIDS in many regions and the continuation of the epidemiological transition in developing countries. The results depend strongly on the assumption that future mortality trends in poor countries will have a relationship to economic and social development similar to those that have occurred in the higher-income countries.

There is indirect evidence that agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \ufffd (PPAR \ufffd ) could reduce macrovascular complications. Our aim, therefore, was to ascertain whether pioglitazone reduces macrovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods We did a prospective, randomised controlled trial in 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes who had evidence of macrovascular disease. We recruited patients from primary-care practices and hospitals. We assigned patients to oral pioglitazone titrated from 15 mg to 45 mg (n=2605) or matching placebo (n=2633), to be taken in addition to their glucose-lowering drugs and other medications. Our primary endpoint was the composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (including silent myocardial infarction), stroke, acute coronary syndrome, endovascular or surgical intervention in the coronary or leg arteries, and amputation above the ankle. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN NCT00174993. Findings Two patients were lost to follow-up, but were included in analyses. The average time of observation was 34\u00b75 months. 514 of 2605 patients in the pioglitazone group and 572 of 2633 patients in the placebo group had at least one event in the primary composite endpoint (HR 0\u00b790, 95% CI 0\u00b780\u20131\u00b702, p=0\u00b7095). The main secondary endpoint was the composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke. 301 patients in the pioglitazone group and 358 in the placebo group reached this endpoint (0\u00b784, 0\u00b772\u20130\u00b798, p=0\u00b7027). Overall safety and tolerability was good with no change in the safety profile of pioglitazone identified. 6% (149 of 2065) and 4% (108 of 2633) of those in the pioglitazone and placebo groups, respectively, were admitted to hospital with heart failure; mortality rates from heart failure did not differ between groups.",

            "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that genome-wide association ( GWA) studies represent a powerful approach to the identification of genes involved in common human diseases. We describe a joint GWA study ( using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K Mapping Array Set) undertaken in the British population, which has examined similar to 2,000 individuals for each of 7 major diseases and a shared set of similar to 3,000 controls. Case-control comparisons identified 24 independent association signals at P < 5 X 10(-7): 1 in bipolar disorder, 1 in coronary artery disease, 9 in Crohn's disease, 3 in rheumatoid arthritis, 7 in type 1 diabetes and 3 in type 2 diabetes. On the basis of prior findings and replication studies thus-far completed, almost all of these signals reflect genuine susceptibility effects. We observed association at many previously identified loci, and found compelling evidence that some loci confer risk for more than one of the diseases studied. Across all diseases, we identified a large number of further signals ( including 58 loci with single-point P values between 10(-5) and 5 X 10(-7)) likely to yield additional susceptibility loci. The importance of appropriately large samples was confirmed by the modest effect sizes observed at most loci identified. This study thus represents a thorough validation of the GWA approach. It has also demonstrated that careful use of a shared control group represents a safe and effective approach to GWA analyses of multiple disease phenotypes; has generated a genome-wide genotype database for future studies of common diseases in the British population; and shown that, provided individuals with non-European ancestry are excluded, the extent of population stratification in the British population is generally modest. Our findings offer new avenues for exploring the pathophysiology of these important disorders. We anticipate that our data, results and software, which will be widely available to other investigators, will provide a powerful resource for human genetics research.",

In plants, this can occur at both the transcriptional and the post-transcriptional levels 1,2,5; however, in animals, only post-transcriptional RNAi has been reported to date. In both plants and animals, RNAi is characterized by the presence of RNAs of about 22 nucleotides in length that are homologous to the gene that is being suppressed 6-8. These 22-nucleotide sequences serve as guide sequences that instruct a multicomponent nuclease, RISC, to destroy specific messenger RNAs 6. Here we identify an enzyme, Dicer, which can produce putative guide RNAs. Dicer is a member of the RNase III family of nucleases that specifically cleave double-stranded RNAs, and is evolutionarily conserved in worms, flies, plants, fungi and mammals. The enzyme has a distinctive structure, which includes a helicase domain and dual RNase III motifs.

Poly(ADP- ribose) polymerase ( PARP) is an enzyme involved in base excision repair, a key pathway in the repair of DNA single- strand breaks(3). We show here that BRCA1 or BRCA2 dysfunction unexpectedly and profoundly sensitizes cells to the inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity, resulting in chromosomal instability, cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis. This seems to be because the inhibition of PARP leads to the persistence of DNA lesions normally repaired by homologous recombination. These results illustrate how different pathways cooperate to repair damage, and suggest that the targeted inhibition of particular DNA repair pathways may allow the design of specific and less toxic therapies for cancer.",

Recently, transcatheter aortic-valve implantation (TAVI) has been suggested as a less invasive treatment for high-risk patients with aortic stenosis. Methods We randomly assigned patients with severe aortic stenosis, whom surgeons considered not to be suitable candidates for surgery, to standard therapy (including balloon aortic valvuloplasty) or transfemoral transcatheter implantation of a balloon-expandable bovine pericardial valve. The primary end point was the rate of death from any cause. Results A total of 358 patients with aortic stenosis who were not considered to be suitable candidates for surgery underwent randomization at 21 centers (17 in the United States). At 1 year, the rate of death from any cause (Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis) was 30.7% with TAVI, as compared with 50.7% with standard therapy (hazard ratio with TAVI, 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0....",

In one approach, we constructed a protein array of about 6,000 yeast transformants, with each transformant expressing one of the open reading frames as a fusion to an activation domain. This array was screened by a simple and automated procedure for 192 yeast proteins, with positive responses identified by their positions in the array. In a second approach, we pooled cells expressing one of about 6,000 activation domain fusions to generate a library. We used a high-throughput screening procedure to screen nearly all of the 6,000 predicted yeast proteins, expressed as Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusion proteins, against the library, and characterized positives by sequence analysis. These approaches resulted in the detection of 957 putative interactions involving 1,004 S. cerevisiae proteins. These data reveal interactions that place functionally unclassified proteins in a biological context, interactions between proteins involved in the same biological function, and interactions that link biological functions together into larger cellular processes. The results of these screens are shown here.",

The identification and analysis of their components provides insight into how the ensemble of expressed proteins (proteome) is organized into functional units. We used tandem-affinity purification (TAP) and mass spectrometry in a large-scale approach to characterize multiprotein complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We processed 1,739 genes, including 1,143 human orthologues of relevance to human biology, and purified 589 protein assemblies. Bioinformatic analysis of these assemblies defined 232 distinct multiprotein complexes and proposed new cellular roles for 344 proteins, including 231 proteins with no previous functional annotation. Comparison of yeast and human complexes showed that conservation across species extends from single proteins to their molecular environment. Our analysis provides an outline of the eukaryotic proteome as a network of protein complexes at a level of organization beyond binary interactions. This higher-order map contains fundamental biological information and offers the context for a more reasoned and informed approach to drug discovery. A formidable challenge of postgenomic biology is to understand how genetic information results in the concerted action of gene products in time and space to generate function. In medicine, this is perhaps best reflected in the numerous disorders based on polygenic traits and the notion that the number of human diseases",

The alpha subunits of HIF are rapidly degraded by the proteasome under normal conditions, but are stabilized by hypoxia(5). Cobaltous ions or iron chelators mimic hypoxia, indicating that the stimuli may interact through effects on a ferroprotein oxygen sensor(6,7). Here we demonstrate a critical role for the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene product pVHL in HIF-1 regulation. In VHL-defective cells, HIF alpha-subunits are constitutively stabilized and HIF-1 is activated. Re-expression of pVHL restored oxygen-dependent instability. pVHL and HIF alpha-subunits co-immunoprecipitate, and pVHL is present in the hypoxic HIF-1 DNA-binding complex. In cells exposed to iron chelation or cobaltous ions, HIF-1 is dissociated from pVHL. These findings indicate that the interaction between HIF-1 and pVHL is iron dependent, and that it is necessary for the oxygen-dependent degradation of HIF alpha-subunits. Thus, constitutive HIF-1 activation may underlie the angiogenic phenotype of VHL-associated tumours. The pVHL/HIF-1 interaction provides a new focus for understanding cellular oxygen sensing.",

Priority-setting is especially important for geographically widespread species with distinct populations subject to multiple threats that operate on different spatial and temporal scales. Marine turtles are widely distributed and exhibit intra-specific variations in population sizes and trends, as well as reproduction and morphology. However, current global extinction risk assessment frameworks do not assess conservation status of spatially and biologically distinct marine turtle Regional Management Units (RMUs), and thus do not capture variations in population trends, impacts of threats, or necessary conservation actions across individual populations. To address this issue, we developed a new assessment framework that allowed us to evaluate, compare and organize marine turtle RMUs according to status and threats criteria. Because conservation priorities can vary widely (i.e. from avoiding imminent extinction to maintaining long-term monitoring efforts) we developed a \u2018\u2018conservation priorities portfolio\u2019\u2019 system using categories of paired risk and threats scores for all RMUs (n = 58). We performed these assessments and rankings globally, by species, by ocean basin, and by recognized geopolitical bodies to identify patterns in risk, threats, and data gaps at different scales. This process resulted in characterization of risk and threats to all marine turtle RMUs, including identification of the world\u2019s 11 most endangered marine turtle RMUs based on highest risk and threats scores. This system also highlighted important gaps in available information that is crucial for accurate conservation assessments. Overall, this priority-setting framework can provide guidance for research and conservation priorities at multiple relevant scales, and should serve as a model for conservation status assessments and prioritysetting for widespread, long-lived taxa.",

However, despite the key role these networks play in sustaining various cellular functions, their large-scale structure is essentially unknown. Here we present the first systematic comparative mathematical analysis of the metabolic networks of 43 organisms representing all three domains of life. We show that, despite significant variances in their individual constituents and pathways, these metabolic networks display the same topologic scaling properties demonstrating striking similarities to the inherent organization of complex non-biological systems. This suggests that the metabolic organization is not only identical for all living organisms, but complies with the design principles of robust and error-tolerant scale-free networks, and may represent a common blueprint for the large-scale organization of interactions among all cellular constituents.",

Recently, the construct of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been proposed to designate an early, but abnormal, state of cognitive impairment. MCI has generated a great deal of research from both clinical and research perspectives. Numerous epidemiological studies have documented the accelerated rate of progression to dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in MCI subjects and certain predictor variables appear valid. However, there has been controversy regarding the precise definition of the concept and its implementation in various clinical settings. Clinical subtypes of MCI have been proposed to broaden the concept and include prodromal forms of a variety of dementias. It is suggested that the diagnosis of MCI can be made in a fashion similar to the clinical diagnoses of dementia and AD. An algorithm is presented to assist the clinician in identifying subjects and subclassifying them into the various types of MCI. By refining the criteria for MCI, clinical trials can be designed with appropriate inclusion and exclusion restrictions to allow for the investigation of therapeutics tailored for specific targets and populations.",

For 2 decades the public health implications of STDs have been recognized and research has detailed the impact of STDs on health particularly of women and children.  Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) for example causes infertility ectopic pregnancies maternal mortality and chronic pain and is the major reason women in many parts of the developing world seek gynecological help.  The classic STDs (such as gonorrhea syphilis chancroid and chlamydial infection) share a primary mode of transmission with HIV infection and may interact with HIV in other ways especially because the presence of a STD seems to facilitate infection with HIV.  Reduction of risky sexual behavior a primary control strategy for STDs has received a lot of attention since AIDS emerged.  Now that health education campaigns are targeted to this goal it has become apparent that we have a woeful lack of understanding of human sexual behavior and its influences.  Diagnosis and treatment of STDs is hampered by a lack of symptoms in the afflicted particularly in women a preference of patients to consult traditional healers and a lack of trained personnel and of drugs.  This last factor is aggravated by STDs which have developed a resistance to antibiotics; to compound this problem alternate drugs are more expensive.  The traditional approach to STD control should be replace by a more cost-effective and equitable integrated public health approach.  STD control should be integrated in primary health care services and with AIDS control programs.  Public health guidelines which prioritize STD activities should include 1)  primary prevention activities 2)  promotion of timely use of health services by afflicted individuals 3)  the use of simple flow-charts and standardized treatment regimes for case management with minimal use of essential drugs 4)  intensified interventions in high-risk groups and 5)  screening for syphilis in pregnant women and prevention of optithalmia neonatorum which should be integrated in maternal and child health services.  Operational research is also needed especially to develop appropriate diagnostic tools in low-resource settings.  Finally women need female-controlled safe sex methods such as the female condom and viricidal agents.  The low status of women prevents them from being able to negotiate for safe sex; yet the subclinical course of STDs in women can have disastrous consequences.",

The term norm that the economist usually uses for the purposes of such comparisons is the operation of a competitive model, that is, the flows of services that would be offered and purchased and the prices that would be paid for them. The interest in the competitive model stems partly from its presumed descriptive power and partly from its implications for economic efficiency. If a competitive equilibrium exists at all and if all commodities relevant to costs or utilities are in fact priced in the market, then the equilibrium is necessarily optimal. There is no other allocation of resources to services that will make all participants in the market better off. The most obvious distinguishing characteristics of an individual's demand for medical services is that it is not steady in origin as, for example, for food or clothing but is irregular and unpredictable. Medical services, apart from preventive services, afford satisfaction only in the event of illness, a departure from the normal state of affairs.",

Attention to qualitative changes in 8 morphological factors is most useful in dating the endometrial biopsy.  During the 1st week of luteal activity attention should be focused on changes occurring in gland epithelium:  gland mitosis pseudostratification of nuclei basal vacuolation and secretion.  During the 2nd week  stromal changes (including edema) predecidual reaction stromal mitosis and leukocytic infiltration are the key criteria.  Tissue from the fundus of the uterus gives the most reliable information.  These critera were used in 300 sterility biopsies taken from normally menstruating women over a 3-year period.  Absence of organic endometrial disease and availability of accurate menstrual history were the only selection criteria.  12 observers dated the biopsies.  42 of the 300 patients (14%) menstruated on the day predicted 36 (12%) menstruated later and 222 (74%) menstruated earlier.  When a +or- 1 day error was allowed 112 patients (38%) were found to menstruate at the time predicted.  When these same slides were reviewed by a single observer and the date for the most advanced area of the biopsy was used 179 patients (60%) menstruated within 1 day of prediction.  To test the validity of the dating criteria change in basal body temperature was used to correlate endometrial dating with ovulation rather than onset of menstruation.  Of the 40 patients who had adequate temperature records 31 (78%) ovulated as predicted allowing a +or- 1 day error indicating that dating is a better gauge of duration of progesterone effect than predictor of onset of menses.  To determine whether biopsy caused early menstruation the secretory phases of the 25 patients who had recorded temperatures in at least 2 cycles in addition to that in which the biopsy was taken were examined.  The secretory phase was definitely shorter in the biopsied than control cycle suggesting that biopsy does accelerate the onset of flow.  However further analysis showed that biopsy does not interfere with length of flow or succeeding menstrual rhythm.",

The molecular basis of most myeloproliferative disorders is unknown. On the basis of the model of chronic myeloid leukaemia, it is expected that a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity could be at the origin of these diseases. Polycythaemia vera is an acquired myeloproliferative disorder, characterized by the presence of polycythaemia diversely associated with thrombocytosis, leukocytosis and splenomegaly(3). Polycythaemia vera progenitors are hypersensitive to erythropoietin and other cytokines(4,5). Here, we describe a clonal and recurrent mutation in the JH2 pseudo-kinase domain of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene in most (>80%) polycythaemia vera patients. The mutation, a valine-to-phenylalanine substitution at amino acid position 617, leads to constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation activity that promotes cytokine hypersensitivity and induces erythrocytosis in a mouse model. As this mutation is also found in other myeloproliferative disorders, this unique mutation will permit a new molecular classification of these disorders and novel therapeutical approaches.",

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of atorvastatin 10 mg daily for primary prevention of major cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes without high concentrations of LDL-cholesterol.#R##N#Methods: 2838 patients aged 40\u201375 years in 132 centres in the UK and Ireland were randomised to placebo (n=1410) or atorvastatin 10 mg daily (n=1428). Study entrants had no documented previous history of cardiovascular disease, an LDL-cholesterol concentration of 4\u00b714 mmol/L or lower, a fasting triglyceride amount of 6\u00b778 mmol/L or less, and at least one of the following: retinopathy, albuminuria, current smoking, or hypertension. The primary endpoint was time to first occurrence of the following: acute coronary heart disease events, coronary revascularisation, or stroke. Analysis was by intention to treat.#R##N#Findings: The trial was terminated 2 years earlier than expected because the prespecified early stopping rule for efficacy had been met. Median duration of follow-up was 3\u00b79 years (IQR 3\u00b70\u20134\u00b77). 127 patients allocated placebo (2\u00b746 per 100 person-years at risk) and 83 allocated atorvastatin (1\u00b754 per 100 person-years at risk) had at least one major cardiovascular event (rate reduction 37% [95% CI \u201352 to \u201317], p=0\u00b7001). Treatment would be expected to prevent at least 37 major vascular events per 1000 such people treated for 4 years. Assessed separately, acute coronary heart disease events were reduced by 36% (\u201355 to \u20139), coronary revascularisations by 31% (\u201359 to 16), and rate of stroke by 48% (\u201369 to \u201311). Atorvastatin reduced the death rate by 27% (\u201348 to 1, p=0\u00b7059). No excess of adverse events was noted in the atorvastatin group.#R##N#Interpretation: Atorvastatin 10 mg daily is safe and efficacious in reducing the risk of first cardiovascular disease events, including stroke, in patients with type 2 diabetes without high LDL-cholesterol. No justification is available for having a particular threshold level of LDL-cholesterol as the sole arbiter of which patients with type 2 diabetes should receive statins. The debate about whether all people with this disorder warrant statin treatment should now focus on whether any patients are at sufficiently low risk for this treatment to be withheld.",

Unlike other creatures, people frequently cooperate with genetically unrelated strangers, often in large groups, with people they will never meet again, and when reputation gains are small or absent. These patterns of cooperation cannot be explained by the nepotistic motives associated with the evolutionary theory of kin selection and the sel\u00aesh motives associated with signalling theory or the theory of reciprocal altruism. Here we show experimentally that the altruistic punishment of defectors is a key motive for the explanation of cooperation. Altruistic punishment means that individuals punish, although the punishment is costly for them and yields no material gain. We show that cooperation \u00afourishes if altruistic punishment is possible, and breaks down if it is ruled out. The evidence indicates that negative emotions towards defectors are the proximate mechanism behind altruistic punishment. These results suggest that future study of the evolution of human cooperation should include a strong focus on explaining altruistic punishment.",

Some of the clones premanently grown and continuously produce large amounts of virus after infection with cytopathic (HTLV-III) variants of these viruses.  1 cytopathic effect of HTLV-III in this system is the arrangement of multiple nuclei in a characteristic ring formation in giant cells of the infected T-cell population.  These structures can be used as an indicator to detect HTLV-III in clinical specimens.  This system opens the way to the routine detection of HTLV-III and related cytopathic variants of HTLV in patients with AIDS or pre-AIDS and in healthy carriers and it provides large amounts of virus for detailed molecular and immunological analyses.

The map is estimated to capture untyped common variation with an average maximum r(2) of between 0.9 and 0.96 depending on population. We demonstrate that the current generation of commercial genome-wide genotyping products captures common Phase II SNPs with an average maximum r(2) of up to 0.8 in African and up to 0.95 in non-African populations, and that potential gains in power in association studies can be obtained through imputation. These data also reveal novel aspects of the structure of linkage disequilibrium. We show that 10-30% of pairs of individuals within a population share at least one region of extended genetic identity arising from recent ancestry and that up to 1% of all common variants are untaggable, primarily because they lie within recombination hotspots. We show that recombination rates vary systematically around genes and between genes of different function. Finally, we demonstrate increased differentiation at non-synonymous, compared to synonymous, SNPs, resulting from systematic differences in the strength or efficacy of natural selection between populations.",

Findings In a training set of 115 tumours, we identified a 76-gene signature consisting of 60 genes for patients positive for oestrogen receptors (ER) and 16 genes for ER-negative patients. This signature showed 93% sensitivity and 48% specificity in a subsequent independent testing set of 171 lymph-node-negative patients. The gene profile was highly informative in identifying patients who developed distant metastases within 5 years (hazard ratio 5\u00b767 (95% CI 2\u00b759-12\u00b74)), even when corrected for traditional prognostic factors in multivariate analysis (5\u00b755 (2\u00b746-12\u00b75)). The 76-gene profile also represented a strong prognostic factor for the development of metastasis in the subgroups of 84 premenopausal patients (9\u00b760 (2\u00b728-40\u00b75)), 87 postmenopausal patients (4\u00b704 (1\u00b757-10\u00b74)), and 79 patients with tumours of 10-20 mm (14\u00b71 (3\u00b734-59\u00b72)), a group of patients for whom prediction of prognosis is especially difficult.",

These responses, called RNA interference or post-transcriptional gene silencing, may provide anti-viral defence, modulate transposition or regulate gene expression. We have taken a biochemical approach towards elucidating the mechanisms underlying this genetic phenomenon. Here we show that 'loss-of- function' phenotypes can be created in cultured Drosophila cells by transfection with specific double-stranded RNAs. This coincides with a marked reduction in the level of cognate cellular messenger RNAs. Extracts of transfected cells contain a nuclease activity that specifically degrades exogenous transcripts homologous to transfected double-stranded RNA. This enzyme contains an essential RNA component. After partial purification, the sequence-specific nuclease co-fractionates with a discrete, ~25-nucleotide RNA species which may confer specificity to the enzyme through homology to the substrate mRNAs.",

Fluid resuscitation improves survival among patients with septic shock, but evidence is lacking to support the choice of either crystalloids or colloids. Methods In a multicenter, two-by-two factorial trial, we randomly assigned patients with severe sepsis to receive either intensive insulin therapy to maintain euglycemia or conventional insulin therapy and either 10% pentastarch, a low-molecular-weight hydroxyethyl starch (HES 200/0.5), or modified Ringer\u2019s lactate for fluid resuscitation. The rate of death at 28 days and the mean score for organ failure were coprimary end points. Results The trial was stopped early for safety reasons. Among 537 patients who could be evaluated, the mean morning blood glucose level was lower in the intensive-therapy group (112 mg per deciliter [6.2 mmol per liter]) than in the conventional-therapy group (151 mg per deciliter [8.4 mmol per liter], P<0.001). However, at 28 days, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the rate of death or the mean score for organ failure. The rate of severe hypoglycemia (glucose level, \u226440 mg per deciliter [2.2 mmol per liter]) was higher in the intensive-therapy group than in the conventional-therapy group (17.0% vs. 4.1%, P<0.001), as was the rate of serious adverse events (10.9% vs. 5.2%, P = 0.01). HES therapy was associated with higher rates of acute renal failure and renal-replacement therapy than was Ringer\u2019s lactate. Conclusions The use of intensive insulin therapy placed critically ill patients with sepsis at increased risk for serious adverse events related to hypoglycemia. As used in this study, HES was harmful, and its toxicity increased with accumulating doses. (ClinicalTrials. gov number, NCT00135473.)",

            "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a gut-derived incretin hormone that stimulates insulin and suppresses glucagon secretion, inhibits gastric emptying, and reduces appetite and food intake. Therapeutic approaches for enhancing incretin action include degradation-resistant GLP-1 receptor agonists (incretin mimetics), and inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) activity (incretin enhancers). Clinical trials with the incretin mimetic exenatide (two injections per day or long-acting release form once weekly) and liraglutide (one injection per day) show reductions in fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations, and haemoglobin A 1c  (HbA 1c ) (1\u20132%), associated with weight loss (2\u20135 kg). The most common adverse event associated with GLP-1 receptor agonists is mild nausea, which lessens over time. Orally administered DPP-4 inhibitors, such as sitagliptin and vildagliptin, reduce HbA 1c  by 0\u00b75\u20131\u00b70%, with few adverse events and no weight gain. These new classes of antidiabetic agents, and incretin mimetics and enhancers, also expand \u03b2-cell mass in preclinical studies. However, long-term clinical studies are needed to determine the benefits of targeting the incretin axis for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.",

            "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that is one of the top three causes of opportunistic human infections. A major factor in its prominence as a pathogen is its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants. Here we report the complete sequence of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1. At 6.3 million base pairs, this is the largest bacterial genome sequenced, and the sequence provides insights into the basis of the versatility and intrinsic drug resistance of P. aeruginosa. Consistent with its larger genome size and environmental adaptability, P. aeruginosa contains the highest proportion of regulatory genes observed for a bacterial genome and a large number of genes involved in the catabolism, transport and efflux of organic compounds as well as four potential chemotaxis systems. We propose that the size and complexity of the P. aeruginosa genome reflect an evolutionary adaptation permitting it to thrive in diverse environments and resist the effects of a variety of antimicrobial substances. P. aeruginosa is a versatile Gram-negative bacterium that grows in soil, marshes and coastal marine habitats, as well as on plant and animal tissues 1 . It forms biofilms on wet surfaces such as those of rocks and soil 2,3 . The emergence of P. aeruginosa as a major opportunistic human pathogen during the past century may be a consequence of its resistance to the antibiotics and disinfectants that eliminate other environmental bacteria. P. aeruginosa is now a significant source of bacteraemia in burn victims, urinary-tract infections in catheterized patients, and hospital-acquired pneumo- nia in patients on respirators 4 . It is also the predominant cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis patients, whose abnormal airway epithelia allow long-term colonization of the lungs by P. aeruginosa. These infections are impossible to eradicate, in part because of the natural resistance of the bacterium to antibiotics, and ultimately lead to pulmonary failure and death. Here we report the sequencing of the genome of P. aeruginosa. The sequence is of interest because of the insights it provides into the role of this bacterium as a pathogen, and because it offers new information on the relationship between genome size, genetic complexity and ecological versatility in bacteria. At 6.3 million base pairs (Mbp), the P. aeruginosa genome is markedly larger than most of the 25 sequenced bacterial genomes. In fact, with 5,570 predicted open reading frames (ORFs), the genetic complexity of P. aeruginosa approaches that of the simple eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whose genome encodes about 6,200 proteins 5 . In contrast, P. aeruginosa has only 30-40% of the number of predicted genes present in the simple metazoans Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster 6 .",

It is unknown how much translational control is exerted by miRNAs on a genome-wide scale. We used a new proteomic approach to measure changes in synthesis of several thousand proteins in response to miRNA transfection or endogenous miRNA knockdown. In parallel, we quantified mRNA levels using microarrays. Here we show that a single miRNA can repress the production of hundreds of proteins, but that this repression is typically relatively mild. A number of known features of the miRNA-binding site such as the seed sequence also govern repression of human protein synthesis, and we report additional target sequence characteristics. We demonstrate that, in addition to downregulating mRNA levels, miRNAs also directly repress translation of hundreds of genes. Finally, our data suggest that a miRNA can, by direct or indirect effects, tune protein synthesis from thousands of genes.",

Here we show that resveratrol shifts the physiology of middle-aged mice on a high-calorie diet towards that of mice on a standard diet and significantly increases their survival. Resveratrol produces changes associated with longer lifespan, including increased insulin sensitivity, reduced insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) levels, increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c coactivator 1a (PGC-1a) activity, increased mitochondrial number, and improved motor function. Parametric analysis of gene set enrichment revealed that resveratrol opposed the effects of the high-calorie diet in 144 out of 153 significantly altered pathways. These data show that improving general health in mammals using small molecules is an attainable goal, and point to new approaches for treating obesity-related disorders and diseases of ageing.",

A key goal for this approach is to create nanostructures of high complexity, matching that routinely achieved by \u2018top-down\u2019 methods. The self-assembly of DNA molecules provides an attractive route towards this goal. Here I describe a simple method for folding long, single-stranded DNA molecules into arbitrary two-dimensional shapes. The design for a desired shape is made by raster-filling the shape with a 7-kilobase single-stranded scaffold and by choosing over 200 short oligonucleotide \u2018staple strands\u2019 to hold the scaffold in place. Once synthesized and mixed, the staple and scaffold strands self-assemble in a single step. The resulting DNA structures are roughly 100 nm in diameter and approximate desired shapes such as squares, disks and five-pointed stars with a spatial resolution of 6 nm. Because each oligonucleotide can serve as a 6-nm pixel, the structures can be programmed to bear complex patterns such as words and images on their surfaces. Finally, individual DNA structures can be programmed to form larger assemblies, including extended periodic lattices and a hexamer of triangles (which constitutes a 30-megadalton molecular complex).",

Here we study the trajectory of 100,000 anonymized mobile phone users whose position is tracked for a six month period. We find that in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing Levy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time independent characteristic length scale and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent based modeling.",

DNA sequences dubbed 'molecular bar codes' uniquely identify each strain, enabling their growth to be analysed in parallel and the fitness contribution of each gene to be quantitatively assessed by hybridization to high-density oligonucleotide arrays. We show that previously known and new genes are necessary for optimal growth under six well-studied conditions: high salt, sorbitol, galactose, pH 8, minimal medium and nystatin treatment.

            "abstract": "Over the last several decades, epidemiological studies have been enormously#R##N#successful in identifying risk factors for major diseases. However, most of this#R##N#research has focused attention on risk factors that are relatively proximal causes of#R##N#disease such as diet, cholesterol level, exercise and the like. We question the#R##N#emphasis on such individually-based risk factors and argue that greater attention#R##N#must be paid to basic social conditions if health reform is to have its maximum#R##N#effect in the time ahead. There are two reasons for this claim. First we argue that#R##N#individually-based risk factors must be contextualized, by examining what puts#R##N#people at risk of risks, if we are to craft effective interventions and improve the#R##N#nation's health. Second, we argue that social factors such as socioeconomic status#R##N#and social support are likely 'fundamental causes\" of disease that, because they#R##N#embody access to important resources, affect multiple disease outcomes throughmultiple mechanisms, and consequently maintain an association with disease even when intervening mechanisms change. Without careful attention to these#R##N#possibilities, we run the risk of imposing individually-based intervention strategies#R##N#that are ineffective and of missing opportunities to adopt broad-based societal#R##N#interventions that could produce substantial health benefits for our citizens",
