            "abstract": "Agriculture is a vital development tool for achieving the Millennium Development Goal that calls for halving by 2015 the share of people suffering from extreme poverty and hunger. That is the overall message of this year's World Development Report (WDR), the 30th in the series. Three out of every four poor people in developing countries live in rural areas, and most of them depend directly or indirectly on agriculture for their livelihoods. This report provides guidance to governments and the international community on designing and implementing agriculture for development agendas that can make a difference in the lives of hundreds of millions of rural poor. The report highlights two major regional challenges. In much of Sub-Saharan Africa, agriculture is a strong option for spurring growth, overcoming poverty, and enhancing food security. Agricultural productivity growth is vital for stimulating growth in other parts of the economy. But accelerated growth requires a sharp productivity increase in smallholder farming combined with more effective support to the millions coping as subsistence farmers, many of them in remote areas. Recent improved performance holds promise, and this report identifies many emerging successes that can be scaled up. In Asia, overcoming widespread poverty requires confronting widening rural-urban income disparities. Asia's fast-growing economies remain home to over 600 million rural people living in extreme poverty, and despite massive rural-urban migration, rural poverty will remain dominant for several more decades. For this reason, the WDR focuses on ways to generate rural jobs by diversifying into labor intensive, high value agriculture linked to a dynamic rural, non-farm sector. In all regions, with rising land and water scarcity and the added pressures of a globalizing world, the future of agriculture is intrinsically tied to better stewardship of natural resources. With the right incentives and investments, agriculture's environmental footprint can be lightened and environmental services harnessed to protect watersheds and biodiversity.",

            "abstract": "In several key industries, including semiconductors, biotechnology, computer software, and the Internet, our patent system is creating a patent thicket: an overlapping set of patent rights requiring that those seeking to commercialize new technology obtain licenses from multiple patentees. The patent thicket is especially thorny when combined with the risk of hold-up, namely the danger that new products will inadvertently infringe on patents issued after these products were designed. The need to navigate the patent thicket and hold-up is especially pronounced in industries such as telecommunications and computing in which formal standard-setting is a core part of bringing new technologies to market. Cross-licenses and patent pools are two natural and effective methods used by market participants to cut through the patent thicket, but each involves some transaction costs. Antitrust law and enforcement, with its historical hostility to cooperation among horizontal rivals, can easily add to these transaction costs. Yet a few relatively simple principles, such as the desirability package licensing for complementary patents but not for substitute patents, can go a long way towards insuring that antitrust will help solve the problems caused by the patent thicket and by hold-up rather than exacerbating them.",

One of the central questions for industrial policy is how to regulate firms with market power. Regulatory Reform tackles this important policy issue in two parts: it describes an analytical framework for studying the main issues in regulatory reform, and then applies the analysis to the British experience in four utility industries--telecommunications, gas, electricity, and water supply. Britain's utility industries, state-owned monopolies just ten years ago, offer a dramatic example of comprehensive reforms with parallels elsewhere: industries have been restructured, markets have been liberalized, and new regulatory methods and institutions have been created. The authors focus on common policy questions that arise in each industry while taking into account the considerable diversity between the industries and the different reform policies adopted. The analysis and experience in Britain's utility industries also provides a rich variety of issues concerning monopolistic and anticompetitive practices that are of interest for competition policy in general.",

In this case, no coding capacity in the strict Shannon sense exists. Simple schemes for time and space diversity are examined, and their potential benefits are illuminated from an information-theoretic stand point. In our presentation, we chose to specialize to the TDMA protocol for the sake of clarity and convenience. Our main arguments and results extend directly to certain variants of other multiple access protocols such as code division multiple access (CDMA) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA), provided that no fast feedback from the receiver to the transmitter is available. >",

            "abstract": "Background: Cyberbullying describes bullying using mobile phones and the internet. Most previous studies have focused on the prevalence of text message and email bullying. Methods: Two surveys with pupils aged 11\u201316 years: (1) 92 pupils from 14 schools, supplemented by focus groups; (2) 533 pupils from 5 schools, to assess the generalisability of findings from the first study, and investigate relationships of cyberbullying to general internet use. Both studies differentiated cyberbullying inside and outside of school, and 7 media of cyberbullying. Results: Both studies found cyberbullying less frequent than traditional bullying, but appreciable, and reported more outside of school than inside. Phone call and text message bullying were most prevalent, with instant messaging bullying in the second study; their impact was perceived as comparable to traditional bullying. Mobile phone/video clip bullying, while rarer, was perceived to have more negative impact. Age and gender differences varied between the two studies. Study 1 found that most cyberbullying was done by one or a few students, usually from the same year group. It often just lasted about a week, but sometimes much longer. The second study found that being a cybervictim, but not a cyberbully, correlated with internet use; many cybervictims were traditional \u2018bully-victims\u2019. Pupils recommended blocking/avoiding messages, and telling someone, as the best coping strategies; but many cybervictims had told nobody about it. Conclusions: Cyberbullying is an important new kind of bullying, with some different characteristics from traditional bullying. Much happens outside school. Implications for research and practical action are discussed. Keywords: Bullying, victim, cyber, mobile phone, internet, adolescence, aggression, computers.",

We observe that, contrary to the popular view that real-time applications necessarily require a fixed delay bound, some real-time applications are more flexible and can adapt to current network conditions. We then propose an ISPN architecture that supports two distinct kinds of real-time service:  guaranteed  service, which is the traditional form of real-time service discussed in most of the literature and involves pre-computed worst-case delay bounds, and  predicted  service which uses the measure performance of the network in computing delay bounds. We then propose a packet scheduling mechanism that can support both of these real-time services as well as accommodate datagram traffic. We also discuss two other aspects of an overall ISPN architecture: the service interface and the admission control criteria.",

This issue is important and has received considerable attention in the popular press concerning the creation of the \"information superhighway\" and its potential impacts on the economy. We use evidence from 21 OECD countries over the past twenty years to examine the impacts that telecommunications developments may have had. We estimate a structural model which endogenizes telecommunication investment by specifying a micro-model of supply and demand for telecommunication investments. The micromodel is then jointly estimated with the macro-growth equation. After controlling for country-specific fixed effects, we find evidence of a positive causal link, provided that a critical mass of telecommunication infrastructure is present.

In this paper, we introduce a simpler evolution scheme for multiobjective problems, called the Pareto archived evolution strategy (PAES). We argue that PAES may represent the simplest possible non-trivial algorithm capable of generating diverse solutions in the Pareto optimal set. The algorithm is identified as being a (1+1) evolution strategy, using local search from a population of one but using a reference archive of previously found solutions in order to identify the approximate dominance ranking of the current and candidate solution vectors. PAES is intended as a good baseline approach, against which more involved methods may be compared, and may also serve well in some real-world applications when local search seems superior to or competitive with population-based methods. The performance of the new algorithm is compared with that of a MOEA based on the niched Pareto GA on a real world application from the telecommunications field. In addition, we include results from experiments carried out on a suite of four test functions, to demonstrate the algorithm's general capability.",

During the design of complex communication systems it is often infeasible to conduct performance analysis and design tradeoff studies using closed-form mathematical formula techniques. Quite frequently, simulation is the only tool available for addressing important issues in the design, analysis, and implementation of communication systems. Simulation can be used to verify the functionality of communication systems, evaluate the performance of proposed systems, and generate specifications to guide their design. Since the early 1980s a variety of modeling and simulation techniques and tools have been developed and used to support the design and implementation of a broad range of communication systems and products ranging from multi-million-dollar communication satellites to handsets for the next generation of personal communication systems. This article presents an overview of the fundamental principles behind modeling and simulation of communication systems.#R##N##R##N##R##N#Keywords:#R##N##R##N#communication systems;#R##N#discrete time representation;#R##N#signals;#R##N#systems;#R##N#modeling of functional blocks;#R##N#simulation of functional blocks;#R##N#Monte Carlo simulation;#R##N#random-number generation;#R##N#performance estimation",

In wireless networks in particular, the different layers interact in a nontrivial manner in order to support information transfer. In this text we will present abstract models that capture the cross-layer interaction from the physical to transport layer in wireless network architectures including cellular, ad-hoc and sensor networks as well as hybrid wireless-wireline. The model allows for arbitrary network topologies as well as traffic forwarding modes, including datagrams and virtual circuits. Furthermore the time varying nature of a wireless network, due either to fading channels or to changing connectivity due to mobility, is adequately captured in our model to allow for state dependent network control policies. Quantitative performance measures that capture the quality of service requirements in these systems depending on the supported applications are discussed, including throughput maximization, energy consumption minimization, rate utility function maximization as well as general performance functionals. Cross-layer control algorithms with optimal or suboptimal performance with respect to the above measures are presented and analyzed. A detailed exposition of the related analysis and design techniques is provided.",

            "abstract": "Software rejuvenation is the concept of gracefully terminating an application and immediately restarting it at a clean internal state. In a client-server type of application where the server is intended to ran perpetually for providing a service to its clients, rejuvenating the server process periodically during the most idle time of the server increases the availability of that service. In a long-running computation-intensive application, rejuvenating the application periodically and restarting it at a previous checkpoint increases the likelihood of successfully completing the application execution. We present a model for analyzing software rejuvenation in such continuously-running applications and express downtime and costs due to downtime during rejuvenation in terms of the parameters in that model. Threshold conditions for rejuvenation to be beneficial are also derived. We implemented a reusable module to perform software rejuvenation. That module can be embedded in any existing application on a UNIX platform with minimal effort. Experiences with software rejuvenation in a billing data collection subsystem of a telecommunications operations system and other continuously-running systems and scientific applications in AT&T are described. >",

However, in this paper we argue that agency-related costs and information transfer costs (\"sticky\" local information) will tend drive the locus of problem-solving in the opposite direction-away from problem-solving by specialist suppliers, and towards those who directly benefit from a solution and who have difficult-to-transfer local information about a particular application being solved, such as the direct users of a product or service. We examine the actual location of design activities in two fields in which custom products are produced by \"mass-customization\" methods: application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and computer telephony integration (CTI) systems. In both, we find that users rather than suppliers are the actual designers of the application-specific portion of the product types examined. We offer anecdotal evidence that the pattern of user-based customization we have documented in these two fields is in fact quite general, and we discuss implications for research and practice.",

The Common Object Request Broker Architecture specification created by the Object Management Group provides a stable model for distributed object-oriented systems that helps developers cope with heterogeneity and inevitable change. Applications written to the CORBA standard are abstracted away from underlying networking protocols and transports, instead relying on object request brokers to provide a fast and flexible communication and object activation substrated. The abstractions provided by CORBA ORBs are currently serving as the basis for applications in a wide variety of problem domains, including telecommunications, finance, medicine, and manufacturing, running on platforms ranging from mainframes down to test and measurement equipment.

A set of necessary and sufficient conditions which a process must satisfy in order to be recoverable is derived. In the PN model, the processes that satisfy these conditions are shown to have some practical limitations. A new model, the time-Petri net (TPN), is introduced to remove these limitations. This new model allows the introduction of constraints in the execution times of its part. As shown in this paper, the TPN appears to be a suitable model for the study of practical recoverable processes.

The standard deviation between measured and predicted path loss is 5.8 dB for the entire data set, and can be as small as 4 dB for specific areas within a building. Average floor attenuation factors, which describe the additional path loss (in decibels) caused by floors between transmitter and receiver, are found for as many as four floors in a typical office building. Path loss contour plots for measured data are presented. In addition, contour plots for the path loss prediction error indicate that the prediction models presented are accurate to within 6 dB for a majority of locations in a building. >",

Structural equation modeling revealed that a slightly modified version of the hypothesised model that assumed three distinct yet correlated constructs\u2014burnout, engagement, and workaholism\u2014fitted the data best. Multiple regression analyses revealed that these three concepts retained unique hypothesised patterns of relationships with variables from five clusters representing (1) long working hours, (2) job characteristics, (3) work outcomes, (4) quality of social relationships, and (5) perceived health, respectively. In sum, our analyses provided converging evidence that workaholism, burnout, and engagement are three different kinds of employee well-being rather than three of a kind.

            "abstract": "Context The expansion and adoption of new methods of communication provide new opportunities for delivering health behavior change interventions. This paper reviews the current research examining mobile telephone short-message service (SMS) for delivering health behavior change interventions via text messages. This service has wide population reach, can be individually tailored, and allows instant delivery with asynchronous receipt, suggesting potential as a delivery channel for health behavior interventions. Evidence acquisition An electronic database search was conducted for studies published between January 1990 and March 2008. Studies were included in the review if they (1) evaluated an intervention delivered primarily via SMS, (2) assessed change in health behavior using pre\u2013post assessment, and (3) were published in English in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Evidence synthesis Of 33 studies identified, 14 met the inclusion criteria. Four of the 14 studies reviewed targeted preventive health behaviors (e.g., smoking cessation), and ten focused on clinical care (e.g., diabetes self-management). Positive behavior change outcomes were observed in 13 of the 14 reviewed studies. Intervention initiation (researcher or participant), SMS dialogue initiation, tailoring of SMS content, and interactivity were found to be important features of SMS-delivered interventions. Methodologic issues with current SMS research were also identified. Conclusions This review suggests that SMS-delivered interventions have positive short-term behavioral outcomes. Further research is required to evaluate interventions for preventive health behaviors that incorporate features found to affect behavioral outcomes and participant acceptance. The quality of studies in this emerging field of research needs to improve to allow the full potential of this medium to be explored.",

Solutions must take under consideration the physical restrictions of low network bandwidth and limited battery life of palmtops. This paper proposes algorithms for multiplexing clustering and nonclustering indexes along with data on wireless networks. The power consumption and the latency for obtaining the required data are considered as the two basic performance criteria for all algorithms. First, this paper describes two algorithms namely, (1, m) indexing and Distributed Indexing, for multiplexing data and its clustering index. Second, an algorithm called Nonclustered Indexing is described for allocating static data and its corresponding nonclustered index. Then, the Nonclustered indexing algorithm is generalized to the case of multiple indexes. Finally, the proposed algorithms are analytically demonstrated to lead to significant improvement of battery life while retaining a low latency.",

However data on the effects of mobile health technology on patient outcomes in resource-limited settings are limited. We aimed to assess whether mobile phone communication between health-care workers and patients starting antiretroviral therapy in Kenya improved drug adherence and suppression of plasma HIV-1 RNA load. METHODS: WelTel Kenya1 was a multisite randomised clinical trial of HIV-infected adults initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in three clinics in Kenya. Patients were randomised (1:1) by simple randomisation with a random number generating program to a mobile phone short message service (SMS) intervention or standard care. Patients in the intervention group received weekly SMS messages from a clinic nurse and were required to respond within 48 h. Randomisation laboratory assays and analyses were done by investigators masked to treatment allocation; however study participants and clinic staff were not masked to treatment. Primary outcomes were self-reported ART adherence (>95% of prescribed doses in the past 30 days at both 6 and 12 month follow-up visits) and plasma HIV-1 viral RNA load suppression (<400 copies per mL) at 12 months. The primary analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00830622. FINDINGS: Between May 2007 and October 2008 we randomly assigned 538 participants to the SMS intervention (n=273) or to standard care (n=265). Adherence to ART was reported in 168 of 273 patients receiving the SMS intervention compared with 132 of 265 in the control group (relative risk [RR] for non-adherence 0.81 95% CI 0.69-0.94; p=0.006). Suppressed viral loads were reported in 156 of 273 patients in the SMS group and 128 of 265 in the control group (RR for virologic failure 0.84 95% CI 0.71-0.99; p=0.04). The number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve greater than 95% adherence was nine (95% CI 5.0-29.5) and the NNT to achieve viral load suppression was 11 (5.8-227.3). INTERPRETATION: Patients who received SMS support had significantly improved ART adherence and rates of viral suppression compared with the control individuals. Mobile phones might be effective tools to improve patient outcome in resource-limited settings. FUNDING: US Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We then look at the regulation-growth linkage using data that cover a large set of manufacturing and service industries over the past two decades. We focus on multifactor productivity (MFP), which plays a crucial role in GDP growth and accounts for a significant share of its cross-country variance. We find evidence that reforms promoting private governance and competition (where these are viable) tend to boost productivity.

Attenuation and propagation delay effects are predicted from meteorological data sets: pressure, temperature, humidity, suspended particle concentration, and rain rate. The physical data base of the propagation model consists of four terms: (a) resonance information for 30 water vapor and 48 oxygen absorption lines in the form of intensity coefficients and center frequency for each line; (b) a composite (oxygen, water vapor, and nitrogen) continuum spectrum; (c) a hydrosol attenuation term for haze, fog, ,and cloud conditions; and (d) a rain attenuation model. Oxygen lines extend into the mesosphere, where they behave in a complicated manner due to the Zeeman effect. The geomagnetic field strength H is required as an additional input parameter. Each 02 line splits proportionally with H into numerous, sub-lines, which are juxtaposed to form a Zeeman pattern spread over a megahertz scale. Patterns for three main polarization cases are calculated. Detailed examples for model atmospheres provide basic millimeter wave propagation information over the height range 0 to 100 km of the neutral atmosphere.",

Any spread spectrum receiver can only suppress a given amount of interference; if the level of interference becomes too great, the system will not function properly. Even under these latter circumstances, however, other techniques, which enhance the performance of the system over and above the performance improvement that comes automatically to systems from using spread spectrum, are available for use. These techniques typically involve some type of additional signal processing and are examined here. Two general types of narrowband interference suppression schemes are discussed and an overview is presented for several other techniques.

This framework provides the requirements to develop m-learning applications that can be used to complement classroom or distance learning. A prototype application was developed to link W/H devices to three course websites. The m-learning applications were pilot-tested for two semesters with a total of 63 students from undergraduate and graduate courses at our university. The students used the m-learning environment with a variety of W/H devices and reported their experiences through a survey and interviews at the end of the semester.

For example, the presence of switching costs can mean that some seemingly loyal customers are actually dissatisfied but do not defect because of high switching costs. Thus, the level of switching costs moderates the link between satisfaction and loyalty. The purposes of this paper are: to examine the moderating role of switching costs in the customer satisfaction\u2010loyalty link; and to identify customer segments and then analyze the heterogeneity in the satisfaction\u2010loyalty link among the different segments.

WSNs have attracted attentions of many researchers in a wide range of topics as Energy Consumption Optimization, Localization Error Minimization, Robustness and Fault-Tolerance, Self-Configuration, Area Coverage, Routing, and Security. As our contribution, in this research book, after reviewing the history and applications of WSNs, we will concentrate on optimizing energy consumption and minimizing sensor nodes localization errors. In order to optimize energy consumption, we will propose solutions based on multi-hop communication and dynamic clustering. For minimizing the localization errors of sensor nodes, we will introduce a method based on regular distribution of anchor nodes and getting weighted average among distances of a sensor node from its surrounding anchor nodes.",

From the network perspective, there will be additional challenges and problems in meeting bandwidth requirements and network management. Many researchers believed that the mobile agent paradigm (mobile object) could propose several attractive solutions to deal with such challenges and problems. A number of mobile agent systems have been designed and implemented in academic institutions and commercial firms. However, few applications were found to take advantage of the mobile agent. Among the hurdles facing this emerging paradigm are concerns about security requirements and efficient resource management. This article introduces the core concepts of this emerging paradigm, and presents an account of current research efforts in the context of telecommunications. The goal is to provide the interested reader with a clear background of the opportunities and challenges this emerging paradigm brings about, and a descriptive look at some of the forerunners that are providing experimental technologies supporting this paradigm.",

This community is currently visible mainly through dedicated international conference series, of which MLEARN is the most prestigious, rather than through any dedicated journals. So far, these forms of development and delivery have focussed on short-term small-scale pilots and trials in the developed countries of Europe, North America, and the Pacific Rim, and there is a taxonomy emerging from these pilots and trials that suggests tacit and pragmatic conceptualisations of mobile learning.#R##N##R##N#What has, however, developed less confidently within this community is any theoretical conceptualisation of mobile learning and with it any evaluation methodologies specifically aligned to the unique attributes of mobile learning.#R##N##R##N#Some advocates of mobile learning attempt to define and conceptualise it in terms of devices and technologies; other advocates define and conceptualise it in terms of the mobility of learners and the mobility of learning, and in terms of the learners\u2019 experience of learning with mobile devices.#R##N##R##N#The role of theory is, perhaps, a contested topic in a community that encompasses philosophical affiliations from empiricists to post-structuralists, each with different expectations about the scope and legitimacy of theory in their work. The mobile learning community may nevertheless need the authority and credibility of some conceptual base.#R##N##R##N#Such a base would provide the starting point for evaluation methodologies grounded in the unique attributes of mobile learning. Attempts to develop the conceptualisations and evaluation of mobile learning, however, must recognise that mobile learning is essentially personal, contextual, and situated; this means it is 'noisy' and this is problematic both for definition and for evaluation.#R##N##R##N#Furthermore, defining mobile learning can emphasise those unique attributes that position it within informal learning, rather than formal. These attributes place much mobile learning at odds with formal learning with its cohorts, courses, semesters, assessments, and campuses, and with its monitoring and evaluation regimes. This raises concerns for the nature of any large-scale and sustained deployment and the extent to which the unique attributes of mobile learning may be lost or compromised.#R##N##R##N#Looking at mobile learning in a wider context, we have to recognise that mobile, personal, and wireless devices are now radically transforming societal notions of discourse and knowledge, and are responsible for new forms of art, employment, language, commerce, deprivation, and crime, as well as learning. With increased popular access to information and knowledge anywhere, anytime, the role of education, perhaps especially formal education, is challenged and the relationships between education, society, and technology are now more dynamic than ever.#R##N##R##N#The paper explores and articulates these issues and the connections between them specifically in the context of the wider and sustained development of mobile learning.",

In recent years, the zero-IF receiver has been introduced in several applications, but its performance cannot be compared to that of the IF receiver yet. This lower performance is closely related to its baseband operation, resulting in filter saturation and distortion, both caused by DC-offsets and self-mixing at the inputs of the mixers. The low-IF receiver has a topology which is closely related to the zero-IF receiver, but it does not operate in the baseband, only near the baseband. The consequences are that, as for the zero-IF receiver, the implementation of a low-IF receiver can be done with a high degree of integration, however, its performance can be better. In this paper, the fundamental principles of the low-IF receiver topology are introduced. Different low-IF receiver topologies are synthesized and fully analyzed in this paper. This is done by applying the complex signal technique-a technique used in digital applications to the study of analog receiver front ends.",

            "abstract": "Multiagent systems are rapidly finding applications in a variety of domains, including robotics, distributed control, telecommunications, and economics. The complexity of many tasks arising in these domains makes them difficult to solve with preprogrammed agent behaviors. The agents must, instead, discover a solution on their own, using learning. A significant part of the research on multiagent learning concerns reinforcement learning techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). A central issue in the field is the formal statement of the multiagent learning goal. Different viewpoints on this issue have led to the proposal of many different goals, among which two focal points can be distinguished: stability of the agents' learning dynamics, and adaptation to the changing behavior of the other agents. The MARL algorithms described in the literature aim---either explicitly or implicitly---at one of these two goals or at a combination of both, in a fully cooperative, fully competitive, or more general setting. A representative selection of these algorithms is discussed in detail in this paper, together with the specific issues that arise in each category. Additionally, the benefits and challenges of MARL are described along with some of the problem domains where the MARL techniques have been applied. Finally, an outlook for the field is provided.",

The RSEB is a use case driven systematic reuse process: architecture and reusable subsystems are first described by use cases and then transformed into object models that are traceable to these use cases. Variability in the RSEB is captured by structuring use case and object models using explicit variation points and variants. Traditional domain engineering steps have been distributed into the steps of the architectural and component system development methods of the RSEB. But the RSEB prescribes no explicit models of the essential features that characterize the different versions. Building on our experience in applying FODA and RSEB to the telecom domain, we have added explicit domain engineering steps and an explicit feature model to the RSEB to support domain engineering and component reuse. These additions provide an effective reuse oriented model as a 'catalog' capability to link use cases, variation points, reusable components and configured applications.",

            "abstract": "Sphere decoding has been suggested by a number of authors as an efficient algorithm to solve various detection problems in digital communications. In some cases, the algorithm is referred to as an algorithm of polynomial complexity without clearly specifying what assumptions are made about the problem structure. Another claim is that although worst-case complexity is exponential, the expected complexity of the algorithm is polynomial. Herein, we study the expected complexity where the problem size is defined to be the number of symbols jointly detected, and our main result is that the expected complexity is exponential for fixed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrary to previous claims. The sphere radius, which is a parameter of the algorithm, must be chosen to ensure a nonvanishing probability of solving the detection problem. This causes the exponential complexity since the squared radius must grow linearly with problem size. The rate of linear increase is, however, dependent on the noise variance, and thus, the rate of the exponential function is strongly dependent on the SNR. Therefore sphere decoding can be efficient for some SNR and problems of moderate size, even though the number of operations required by the algorithm strictly speaking always grows as an exponential function of the problem size.",

Sixty-six percent e-mail peers about classes; 44% e-mail for studying. In contrast, only 43% e-mail on PCs, exchanging an average of only two messages per week. Only 20% had used a personal digital assistant. Second, we e-mailed 100-word English vocabulary lessons at timed intervals to the mobile phones of 44 Japanese university students, hoping to promote regular study. Compared with students urged to regularly study identical materials on paper or Web, students receiving mobile e-mail learned more (Po0.05). Seventy-one percent of the subjects preferred receiving these lessons on mobile phones rather than PCs. Ninety-three percent felt this a valuable teaching method. Third, we created a Web site explaining English idioms. Student-produced animation shows each idiom\u2019s literal meaning; a video shows the idiomatic meaning.

With nearly half the adult population in the United States and Canada having literacy levels below what is needed to fully engage in an information-rich society, the implications for using information technology to promote health and aid in health care, or for eHealth, are considerable. Engaging with eHealth requires a skill set, or literacy, of its own. The concept of eHealth literacy is introduced and defined as the ability to seek, find, understand, and appraise health information from electronic sources and apply the knowledge gained to addressing or solving a health problem. In this paper, a model of eHealth literacy is introduced, comprised of multiple literacy types, including an outline of a set of fundamental skills consumers require to derive direct benefits from eHealth. A profile of each literacy type with examples of the problems patient-clients might present is provided along with a resource list to aid health practitioners in supporting literacy improvement with their patient-clients across each domain. Facets of the model are illustrated through a set of clinical cases to demonstrate how health practitioners can address eHealth literacy issues in clinical or public health practice. Potential future applications of the model are discussed.#N##N# [J Med Internet Res 2006;8(2):e9]",

This year's conference focused on new development thinking, crises and recovery, corporate governance and restructuring, and, social security, public and private savings. The opening address outlines challenges for development, that include the intransigence of poverty in Africa, and ways to establish public-private partnerships at the country, and global levels, while the keynote address identifies equilibrium, and change as the focus of development economics: long-term sustainable growth requires development of a consensus behind the reform policies. Discussions varied from crises and recovery, through perspectives on the recent history of transition economies, to arguments on the possibilities of poverty reduction on a grand scale. Other topics include the exploration of development strategies, revision of the role of aid in providing finance, changing policies, and knowledge transfer, and, how to coordinate development problems.",

In the design study, a rigorous top down approach is adopted starting from the most essential objectives and requirements of universal third-generation mobile systems. Emphasis is laid on high flexibility with respect to the implementation of a wide range of services and service bit rates including variable rate and packet services. Flexibility in frequency and radio resource management, system and service deployment, and easy operation in mixed-cell and multioperator scenarios are further important design goals. The system concept under investigation is centered around an open and flexible radio interface architecture based on asynchronous direct-sequence CDMA with three different chip rates of approximately 1, 5, and 20 Mchip/s. The presented CDMA system concept forms the basis for an experimental test system (testbed) which is currently under development. This experimental system concept has been jointly established by the partners in the European RACE project R2020 (CODIT). The paper describes the radio transmission scheme and appropriate receiver principles and presents first performance results based on simulations. >",

            "abstract": "Vendor selection of a telecommunications system is an important problem to a telecommunications company as the telecommunications system is a long-term investment for the company and the success of telecommunications services is directly affected by the vendor selection decision. Furthermore, the vendor selection of a telecommunications system is a complex multi-person, multi-criteria decision problem. The group decision-making process can be improved by a systematic and logical approach to assess priorities based on the inputs of several people from different functional areas within the company. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) can be very useful in involving several decision-makers with different conflicting objectives to arrive at a consensus decision. In this paper, an AHP-based model is formulated and applied to a real case study to examine its feasibility in selecting a vendor for a telecommunications system. The use of the proposed model indicates that it can be applied to improve the group decision making in selecting a vendor that satisfies customer specifications. Also, it is found that the decision process is systematic and that using the proposed AHP model can reduce the time taken to select a vendor.",

They were introduced in 1993 by Berrou, Glavieux and Thitimajshima, and claimed to achieve near Shannon-limit error correction performance with relatively simple component codes and large interleavers. A required E/sub b//N/sub o/ of 0.7 dB was reported for BER of 10/sup -5/ and code rate of 1/2. However, some important details that are necessary to reproduce these results were omitted. This paper confirms the accuracy of these claims, and presents a complete description of an encoder/decoder pair that could be suitable for PCS applications. We describe a new simple method for trellis termination, we analyze the effect of interleaver choice on the weight distribution of the code, and we introduce the use of unequal rate component codes which yields better performance. Turbo codes are extended to encoders with multiple codes and a suitable decoder structure is developed, which is substantially different from the decoder for two-code based encoders.",

Attention is focused primarily on the author's canonical statistical-physical Class A and Class B models. In particular, Class A noise describes the type of electromagnetic interference (EMI) often encountered in telecommunication applications, where this ambient noise is largely due to other, \"intelligent\" telecommunication operations. On the other hand, ambient Class B noise usually represents man-made or natural \"nonintelligent\"-i.e., nonmessage-bearing noise-and is highly impulsive. Class A noise is not an /spl alpha/-stable process, nor is it reducible to such, except in the limiting Gaussian cases of high-density noise (by the central limit theorem). Class B noise is also asymptotically normal (before model approximation). Under rather broad conditions, principally governed by the source propagation and distribution scenarios, the PDF of Class B noise alone (no Gaussian component) can usually be approximated by (1) a symmetric Gaussian /spl alpha/-stable (S/spl alpha/S) model in the case of narrowband reception, or when the PDF /spl omega//sub 1/(/spl alpha/) of the amplitude is symmetric; and (2) a nonsymmetric /spl alpha/-stable (NS/spl alpha/S) model (no Gaussian component) can be constructed in broadband regimes. New results here include: (i) counting functional methods for constructing the general qth-order characteristic functions (CFs) of Class A and Class B noise, from which (all) moments and (in principle), the PDFs follow; (ii) the first-order CFs, PDFs, and cumulative probabilities (APDs) of nonsymmetric broadband Class B noise, extended to include additive Gauss noise (AGN); (iii) proof of the existence of all moments in the basic Class A and Class B models; (iv) the key physical role of AGN and the fact that AGN removes /spl alpha/-stability; (v) the explicit roles of the propagation and distribution scenarios; and (vi) extension to noise fields. Although telecommunication applications are emphasized, Class A and Class B noise models apply selectively, but equally well, to other physical regimes, e.g., underwater acoustics and EM (radar, optics, etc.). Supportive empirical data are included.",

If not, adaptation is stopped for the current iteration. In the paper, this \"stopand-go\" decision-directed algorithm is presented for both linear and decision-feedback MSE complex equalizers with joint blind carrier recovery.

Results of a series of SEM analyses largely supported these dual processes.

We have conducted several relatively large projects in which we applied these techniques to systems with millions of lines of code. Given the complexity of testing, the model-based testing approach was used in conjunction with test automation harnesses. Since no large empirical study has been conducted to measure efficacy of this new approach, we report on our experience with developing tools and methods in support of model-based testing.

We conducted a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of mobile technology interventions delivered to health care consumers. #N##N#METHODS AND FINDINGS We searched for all controlled trials of mobile technology-based health interventions delivered to health care consumers using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Global Health, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, UK NHS HTA (Jan 1990-Sept 2010). Two authors extracted data on allocation concealment, allocation sequence, blinding, completeness of follow-up, and measures of effect. We calculated effect estimates and used random effects meta-analysis. We identified 75 trials. Fifty-nine trials investigated the use of mobile technologies to improve disease management and 26 trials investigated their use to change health behaviours. Nearly all trials were conducted in high-income countries. Four trials had a low risk of bias. Two trials of disease management had low risk of bias; in one, antiretroviral (ART) adherence, use of text messages reduced high viral load (>400 copies), with a relative risk (RR) of 0.85 (95% CI 0.72-0.99), but no statistically significant benefit on mortality (RR 0.79 [95% CI 0.47-1.32]). In a second, a PDA based intervention increased scores for perceived self care agency in lung transplant patients. Two trials of health behaviour management had low risk of bias. The pooled effect of text messaging smoking cessation support on biochemically verified smoking cessation was (RR 2.16 [95% CI 1.77-2.62]). Interventions for other conditions showed suggestive benefits in some cases, but the results were not consistent. No evidence of publication bias was demonstrated on visual or statistical examination of the funnel plots for either disease management or health behaviours. To address the limitation of the older search, we also reviewed more recent literature. #N##N#CONCLUSIONS Text messaging interventions increased adherence to ART and smoking cessation and should be considered for inclusion in services. Although there is suggestive evidence of benefit in some other areas, high quality adequately powered trials of optimised interventions are required to evaluate effects on objective outcomes.

A simple algorithm for computer implementation of the technique and computer simulation results for both line-of-sight and diffuse transmitter configurations are also presented. In both cases, it is shown that reflections of multiple order are a significant source of intersymbol interference. Experimental measurements of optical multipath, which help verify the accuracy of the simulations, are discussed. >",

The optimal performance of the network can only be achieved by simultaneous optimization of routing and resource allocation. In this paper, we formulate the simultaneous routing and resource allocation (SRRA) problem, and exploit problem structure to derive efficient solution methods. We use a capacitated multicommodity flow model to describe the data flows in the network. We assume that the capacity of a wireless link is a concave and increasing function of the communications resources allocated to the link, and the communications resources for groups of links are limited. These assumptions allow us to formulate the SRRA problem as a convex optimization problem over the network flow variables and the communications variables. These two sets of variables are coupled only through the link capacity constraints. We exploit this separable structure by dual decomposition. The resulting solution method attains the optimal coordination of data routing in the network layer and resource allocation in the radio control layer via pricing on the link capacities.",

Even if the answers to these questions favor private ownership, the question must still be asked: Do distortions in the process of privatization mean that privatized firms perform worse than state enterprises? The author's review found greater ambiguity about the merits of privatization and private ownership in the theoretical literature than in the empirical literature. In most cases, empirical research strongly favors private ownership in competitive markets over a state-owned counterfactual (although construction of the counterfactual is itself a problem). Theory's ambiguity about ownership in monopoly markets seems better justified. Since the choice confronting governments is between state ownership and privatization rather than between privatization and optimality, theory has left a gap that empirical work has tried to fill. Further research is needed.",

A constructive achievability proof shows that zero forcing is sufficient to achieve all the available DOF on the two user MIMO interference channel.

Quantitative relationships between QoE and QoS are required in order to be able to build effective QoE control mechanisms onto measurable QoS parameters. Against this background, this article proposes a generic formula in which QoE and QoS parameters are connected through an exponential relationship, called IQX hypothesis. The formula relates changes of QoE with respect to QoS to the current level of QoE, is simple to match, and its limit behaviors are straightforward to interpret. It validates the IQX hypothesis for streaming services, where QoE in terms of Mean Opinion Scores is expressed as functions of loss and reordering ratio, the latter of which is caused by jitter. For web surfing as the second application area, matchings provided by the IQX hypothesis are shown to outperform previously published logarithmic functions. We conclude that the IQX hypothesis is a strong candidate to be taken into account when deriving relationships between QoE and QoS parameters.",

This paper recommends an optimal sizing method to optimize the configurations of a hybrid solar\u2013wind system employing battery banks. Based on a genetic algorithm (GA), which has the ability to attain the global optimum with relative computational simplicity, one optimal sizing method was developed to calculate the optimum system configuration that can achieve the customers required loss of power supply probability (LPSP) with a minimum annualized cost of system (ACS). The decision variables included in the optimization process are the PV module number, wind turbine number, battery number, PV module slope angle and wind turbine installation height. The proposed method has been applied to the analysis of a hybrid system which supplies power for a telecommunication relay station, and good optimization performance has been found. Furthermore, the relationships between system power reliability and system configurations were also given.",

In conventional design, higher levels of synthesis produce a netlist, from which layout synthesis builds a mask specification for manufacturing. Timing analysis is built into a feedback loop to detect timing violations which are then used to update specifications to synthesis. Such iteration is undesirable, and for very high performance designs, infeasible. The problem is likely to become much worse with future generations of technology. To achieve a non-iterative design flow, we propose that early synthesis stages should use \u201cwireplanning\u201d to distribute delays over the functional elements and interconnect, and layout synthesis should use its degrees of freedom to realize those delays. In this paper we attempt to quantify this problem for future technologies and propose some solutions for a \u201cconstant delay\u201d methodology.",

The empirical strategy involves the estimation of simple equations for GDP growth and conventional inequality measures, augmented to include, among the regressors, infrastructure quantity and quality indicators, in addition to standard controls. To account for the potential endogeneity of infrastructure (as well as that of other regressors), the authors use a variety of generalized-method-of-moments (GMM) estimators based on both internal and external instruments and report results using both disaggregated and synthetic measures of infrastructure quantity and quality. The two robust results are: (1) growth is positively affected by the stock of infrastructure assets, and (2) income inequality declines with higher infrastructure quantity and quality. A variety of specification tests suggests that these results do capture the causal impact of the exogenous component of infrastructure quantity and quality on growth and inequality. These two results combined suggest that infrastructure development can be highly effective to combat poverty. Furthermore, illustrative simulations for Latin American countries suggest that these impacts are economically quite significant, and highlight the growth acceleration and inequality reduction that would result from increased availability, and quality of infrastructure.",

The architecture presented attempts to integrate these communications protocols with the DCS in a smooth fashion in order to ease the writing of multimedia applications. Two issues are identified as being essential to the success of this integration: the synchronization of related real-time data streams, and the management of heterogeneous multimedia hardware. The synchronization problem is tackled by defining explicit synchronization properties at the presentation level and by providing control and synchronization operations within the DCS which operate in terms of these properties. The heterogeneity problems are addressed by separating the data transport semantics (protocols themselves) from the control semantics (protocol interfaces). >",

For instance, some of the data may be known only within specified bounds, while other data may be known only in terms of ordinal relations. DEA with imprecise data or, more compactly, the Imprecise Data Envelopment Analysis (IDEA) method developed in this paper permits mixtures of imprecisely- and exactly-known data, which the IDEA models transform into ordinary linear programming forms. This is carried even further in the present paper to comprehend the now extensively employed Assurance Region (AR) concepts in which bounds are placed on the variables rather than the data. We refer to this approach as AR-IDEA, because it replaces conditions on the variables with transformations of the data and thus also aligns the developments we describe in this paper with what are known as cone-ratio envelopments in DEA. As a result, one unified approach, referred to as the AR-IDEA model, is achieved which includes not only imprecise data capabilities but also assurance region and cone-ratio envelopment concepts.",

In analyzing Africa's intensifying relationships with China and India, Africa's Silk Road examines the trends to date and considers the implications of these developments for the economic future of the African continent. The diagnosis cautions that the opportunities engendered by China and India's trade and investment with Africa will not necessarily be converted into growth and poverty reduction in the region. A critical finding of the study is that it is not just the quantity of these trade and investment flows that matters-it is also the quality of the overall commercial relationships underlying as well as shaping these flows.

The coherent multireceiver is capable of perfectly measuring the channel amplitudes and phases whereas, at the other extreme, the noncoherent multireceiver implies a receiver which requires no channel measurement whatsoever. The multichannel model presumes that each transmission mode supports a specular or fixed component and a random or scatter component which fades according to the Rayleigh distribution. Heretofore, performance analyses of multichannel links have assumed that the fading obeys the Rayleigh law. This multichannel model is sufficiently general to include four practical types: the Rician and the Rayleigh fading multichannels, multichannels whose propagation modes do not fade, and those which simultaneously contain Rician and Rayleigh fading propagation paths or the so called mixed-mode multichannel. Error probabilities are graphically illustrated and compared for various multichannel models. It is found that the effectiveness of multichannel reception is highly dependent on the strength of the specular channel component relative to the mean squared value of the random channel component. In particular, multichannel reception is more effective when applied to the completely random multichannel. For special cases the error-rate expressions reduce to well-known results.",

The discovery of the corresponding elements and their fist industrial uses were intimately linked to their optical properties. This relationship has been kept alive until today when many high-technology applications of lanthanide-containing materials such as energy -saving lighting devices, displays, optical fibers and amplifiers, lasers, responsive luminescent stains for biomedical analyses and in cellulo sensing and imaging heavily rely on the brilliant and pure-color emission of lanthanide ions. In this review we first outlined the basics of lanthanide luminescence with emphasis on f-f transitions, the sensitization mechanisms, and the assessment of the luminescence efficiency of lanthanide-containing emissive molecular edifices. Emphasis was then put on two fast developing aspects of lanthanide luminescence: materials for telecommunications and light emitting diodes, and biomedical imaging and sensing. Recent advances in NIR-emitting materials for plastic amplifiers and waveguides were described, together with the main solutions brought by researchers to minimize non-radiative deactivation of excited states. The demonstration in 1999 that erbium tris(8-hydroxyquinolinate) displayed a bright green emission suitable for orgenic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) was followed by realizing that in OLEDs, 25% of the excitation energy leads to singlet states and 75% to triplet states. Since lanthanide ions are good triplet quenchers, they now also play a key role in the development of these lighting devices. Luminescence analyses of biological molecules are among the most sensitive analytical techniques known. The long lifetime of the lanthanide excited states allows time-resolved spectroscopy to be used, suppressing the sample autofluorescence and reaching very low detection limits. Not only visible lanthanide sensors are now ubiquitously provided in medical diagnosis and in cell imaging, but the feasibility of using NIR emission of ions such as Ybm is now being tested because of deeper penetration in biological tissues Key wonls: lanthanide luminescence; sensitization; near infrared; telecommunications; organic light emitting diode (OLED);",

Observations on the geometric structure of these quantizers are made, which have an important implication on the encoding complexity. For the squared-error distortion measure, it is shown that an operation equivalent to a Euclidean distance measurement with respect to an appropriately defined set of points (used to identify the encoding regions) can be used to perform the encoding. This implies that the encoding complexity is proportional to the number of encoding regions. It is then demonstrated that for very noisy channels and a heavily correlated source, when the codebook size is large, the number of encoding regions is considerably smaller than the codebook size-implying a reduction in encoding complexity. >",

            "abstract": "Direct radio-based vehicle-to-vehicle communication can help prevent accidents by providing accurate and up-to-date local status and hazard information to the driver. In this paper, we assume that two types of messages are used for traffic safety-related communication: 1) Periodic messages (ldquobeaconsrdquo) that are sent by all vehicles to inform their neighbors about their current status (i.e., position) and 2) event-driven messages that are sent whenever a hazard has been detected. In IEEE 802.11 distributed-coordination-function-based vehicular networks, interferences and packet collisions can lead to the failure of the reception of safety-critical information, in particular when the beaconing load leads to an almost-saturated channel, as it could easily happen in many critical vehicular traffic conditions. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of transmit power control to avoid saturated channel conditions and ensure the best use of the channel for safety-related purposes. We propose a distributed transmit power control method based on a strict fairness criterion, i.e., distributed fair power adjustment for vehicular environments (D-FPAV), to control the load of periodic messages on the channel. The benefits are twofold: 1) The bandwidth is made available for higher priority data like dissemination of warnings, and 2) beacons from different vehicles are treated with ldquoequal rights,rdquo and therefore, the best possible reception under the available bandwidth constraints is ensured. We formally prove the fairness of the proposed approach. Then, we make use of the ns-2 simulator that was significantly enhanced by realistic highway mobility patterns, improved radio propagation, receiver models, and the IEEE 802.11p specifications to show the beneficial impact of D-FPAV for safety-related communications. We finally put forward a method, i.e., emergency message dissemination for vehicular environments (EMDV), for fast and effective multihop information dissemination of event-driven messages and show that EMDV benefits of the beaconing load control provided by D-FPAV with respect to both probability of reception and latency.",

To derive these equalizers, one works in the D-transform domain and uses prediction theory results. Partial-response MMSE equalizers are also found. As an application, the author considers a pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) communication system with ISI and cyclostationary inputs. The MMSE linear and DF equalizers are determined by studying an equivalent MIMO system. The resulting filters are expressed in compact matrix notation and are time-invariant, whereas the corresponding single input/single output filters are periodically time-invariant. The author also considers MMSE equalizers for a wide-sense stationary process by introducing a 'random phase'. To aid in the performance evaluation of various equalizers, the author derives their mean square errors. >",

The established value chain is increasingly being deconstructed, with the entry of powerful new players and radical restructuring of the industry. Rapid technological developments and increasing market turbulences have added new dimensions to an already complex scenario. Many tested business models, as well as related frameworks, tools and techniques, have become obsolete. The paper uses recent evidence to illustrate the evolving telecommunications value chains and market structure, examine the underlying theoretical and practical reasons for such changes, and highlight the strategic implications for the various players involved. The paper concludes that some of the current changes in the telecommunications industry are very radical, and all players need to re-evaluate their strategies and market positions and make hard decisions as to where to go next. The value chains are rapidly evolving into value networks, with multiple entry and exit points, creating enormous complexity for all the players involved. Further research is urgently needed to map out the telecommunications value chains and value networks that are possible in the context of the new economy; identify the different players and the possible strategies and business models that they can adopt; develop new conceptual frameworks for understanding the current changes in the telecommunications and related industries; and create new tools and techniques for identifying opportunities and threats and for making new strategies.",

This industry is an example of a high-tech industry in which standards play a large role. In the process of designing the GSM standard, a lot of attention has been given to IPRs, mainly to avoid a situation in which a single IPR holder could hamper or even totally block the development of the standard. Nevertheless, the ultimate GSM standard contains a large amount of so-called \u2018essential IPRs\u2019, i.e., IPRs without which the implementation of GSM products is impossible. The paper starts with a general discussion of the development of GSM, and the role of firm strategy and IPRs in this process. Next, we present a database on the essential IPRs in the GSM standard. This database has been compiled on the basis of international patent statistics, and the data that manufacturers have supplied to ETSI, the European standardization body re sponsible for defining the GSM standard. We use this database to assess the dynamic IPR position of firms in the original GSM standard and its subsequent development. In a next part of our analysis, we relate the firm\u2019s IPR p osition to the trends in strategic technology agreements in the mobile telecommunications field. We ask the question whether firms that are powerful in terms of IPRs are also the firms that are \u2018central\u2019 in the technology agreements network (or vice versa). We also investigate whether developments over time in the technology agreements data follow from the dynamic movements in the IPR position of a firm, and which other factors play a role in this.",

The models are static polynomial, parallel Hammerstein (PH), Volterra, and radial basis-function neural network (RBFNN). Two PAs were investigated: one was designed for the third-generation (3G) mobile telecommunication systems and one was designed for the second-generation (2G). The RBFNN reduced the total model error slightly more than the PH, but the error out of band was significantly lower for the PH. The Volterra was found to give a lower model error than did a PH of the same nonlinear order and memory depth. The PH could give a lower model error than the best Volterra, since the former could be identified with a higher nonlinear order and memory depth. The qualitative conclusions are the same for the 2G and 3G PAs, but the model errors are smaller for the latter. For the 3G PA, a static polynomial gave a low model error as low as the best PH and lower than the RBFNN for the hardest cross validation. The models with memory, PH, and RBFNN, showed better cross-validation performance, in terms of lower model errors, than a static polynomial for the hardest cross validation of the 2G PA",

This paper cautiously suggests that the use of information and communications technologies could enable a new, virtual mobility, enabling an Internet-based increase in accessibility as an alternative to an increase in physical mobility. Finally, consideration is given to the possibility of a virtual mobility-related dimension of exclusion and to the possible social implications of inclusion of virtual mobility in an integrated transport strategy.",

The AICD will provide a baseline against which future improvements in infrastructure services can be measured, making it possible to monitor the results achieved from donor support. It should also provide a more solid empirical foundation for prioritizing investments and designing policy reforms in the infrastructure sectors in Africa. The AICD is based on an unprecedented effort to collect detailed economic and technical data on the infrastructure sectors in Africa. The project has produced a series of original reports on public expenditure, spending needs, and sector performance in each of the main infrastructure sectors, including energy, information and communication technologies, irrigation, transport, and water and sanitation. The first phase of the AICD focused on 24 countries that together account for 85 percent of the gross domestic product, population, and infrastructure aid flows of Sub-Saharan Africa. Under a second phase of the project, coverage is expanding to include as many of the additional African countries as possible.",

            "abstract": "Hitherto communication theory was based on two alternative methods of signal analysis. One is the description of the signal as a function of time; the other is Fourier analysis. Both are idealizations, as the first method operates with sharply defined instants of time, the second with infinite wave-trains of rigorously defined frequencies. But our everyday experiences\u2014especially our auditory sensations\u2014insist on a description in terms of both time and frequency. In the present paper this point of view is developed in quantitative language. Signals are represented in two dimensions, with time and frequency as co-ordinates. Such two-dimensional representations can be called \u201cinformation diagrams,\u201d as areas in them are proportional to the number of independent data which they can convey. This is a consequence of the fact that the frequency of a signal which is not of infinite duration can be defined only with a certain inaccuracy, which is inversely proportional to the duration, and vice versa. This \u201cuncertainty relation\u201d suggests a new method of description, intermediate between the two extremes of time analysis and spectral analysis. There are certain \u201celementary signals\u201d which occupy the smallest possible area in the information diagram. They are harmonic oscillations modulated by a \u201cprobability pulse.\u201d Each elementary signal can be considered as conveying exactly one datum, or one \u201cquantum of information.\u201d Any signal can be expanded in terms of these by a process which includes time analysis and Fourier analysis as extreme cases.These new methods of analysis, which involve some of the mathematical apparatus of quantum theory, are illustrated by application to some problems of transmission theory, such as direct generation of single sidebands, signals transmitted in minimum time through limited frequency channels, frequency modulation and time-division multiplex telephony.",

The near-far problem occurs when the amplitudes of the users received signals are very dissimilar, as the case might be in many important applications. In particular, the standard method for estimating the propagation delays will fail in a near-far situation. Several new estimators, the maximum likelihood, an approximative maximum likelihood and a subspace-based estimator, are therefore proposed and are shown to be robust against the near-far problem. No knowledge of the transmitted bits is assumed, and the proposed estimators can thus be used for both acquisition and tracking. In addition, the Cramer-Rao bound is derived for the parameter estimation problem.",

It is based on systematic comparison of case studies from 10 countries--Brazil, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Mexico, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, and the United States. It finds that B2B e-commerce seems to be driven by global forces, whereas B2C seems to be more of a local phenomenon. A preliminary explanation for this difference is that B2B is driven by global competition and MNCs that \"push\" e-commerce to their global suppliers, customers, and subsidiaries. This in turn creates pressures on local companies to adopt e-commerce to stay competitive. In contrast, B2C is \"pulled\" by consumer markets, which are mainly local and therefore divergent. While all consumers desire convenience and low prices, consumer preferences and values, national culture, and distribution systems differ markedly across countries and define differences in local consumer markets.

We have developed techniques for uncovering and measuring the discrepancies between models and executions, which we call  process validation . Process validation takes a process execution and a process model, and measures the level of correspondence between the two. Our metrics are tailorable and give process engineers control over determining the severity of different types of  discrepancies. The techniques provide detailed information once a high-level measurement indicates the presence of a problem.

However, with increased benefit has come increased risk. As they have grown more complex to handle a variety of demands, these infrastructures have become more interdependent. This strong interdependence means that an action in one part of one infrastructure network can rapidly create global effects by cascading throughout the same network and even into other networks. Moreover, interdependence is only one of several characteristics that challenge the control and reliable operation of these networks. These characteristics, in turn, present unique challenges in modeling, prediction, simulation, cause-and-effect relationships, analysis, optimization, and control. Deregulation and economic factors and policies and human performance also affect these networks. The Complex Interactive Networks/Systems Initiative (GIN/SI) is a joint program by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the US Department of Defense (DOD) that is addressing many of these issues. The goal of the 5-year, $30 million effort, which is part of the Government-Industry Collaborative University Research (GICUR) program, is to develop new tools and techniques that will enable large national infrastructures to self-heal in response to threats, material failures, and other destabilizers. Of particular interest is how to model enterprises at the appropriate level of complexity in critical infrastructure systems.",

By contrast, many studies have shown that over the past 30 years, private (or privatized) enterprises in developing countries have, on average, delivered superior performance and needed investments. Explanations differ on why this discrepancy exists. Private enterprises are driven by a desire for profits and may have more professional know-how in management, operating procedures, and use of appropriate technology. But perhaps the most important reason for their stronger performance is that privatization makes intervening in enterprise operations difficult for governments and politicians, so government manipulation is less likely. However, the issue, in general, has been how to ensure that the improved performance and efficiency gains are passed through to the users through lower tariffs and increased coverage, while allowing firms to earn a fair rate of return on their investments.",

We aimed to conduct a systematic review of controlled trials of mobile technology interventions to improve health care delivery processes. #N##N#METHODS AND FINDINGS We searched for all controlled trials of mobile technology based health interventions using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Global Health, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, UK NHS HTA (Jan 1990-Sept 2010). Two authors independently extracted data on allocation concealment, allocation sequence, blinding, completeness of follow-up, and measures of effect. We calculated effect estimates and we used random effects meta-analysis to give pooled estimates. We identified 42 trials. None of the trials had low risk of bias. Seven trials of health care provider support reported 25 outcomes regarding appropriate disease management, of which 11 showed statistically significant benefits. One trial reported a statistically significant improvement in nurse/surgeon communication using mobile phones. Two trials reported statistically significant reductions in correct diagnoses using mobile technology photos compared to gold standard. The pooled effect on appointment attendance using text message (short message service or SMS) reminders versus no reminder was increased, with a relative risk (RR) of 1.06 (95% CI 1.05-1.07, \u200a=\u200a6%). The pooled effects on the number of cancelled appointments was not significantly increased RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.89-1.30). There was no difference in attendance using SMS reminders versus other reminders (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.94-1.02, respectively). To address the limitation of the older search, we also reviewed more recent literature. #N##N#CONCLUSIONS The results for health care provider support interventions on diagnosis and management outcomes are generally consistent with modest benefits. Trials using mobile technology-based photos reported reductions in correct diagnoses when compared to the gold standard. SMS appointment reminders have modest benefits and may be appropriate for implementation. High quality trials measuring clinical outcomes are needed.

The analysis, based on an unbalanced panel of Romanian firms from 1998-2000, provides evidence consistent with positive intra-sectoral spillovers resulting from fully-owned foreign affiliates but not from projects with joint domestic and foreign ownership. This finding is consistent with literature suggesting that foreign investors tend to put more resources into technology transfer to their wholly-owned projects than to those owned partially. The data also indicate that the presence of partially foreign-owned projects is correlated with higher productivity of domestic firms in upstream industries, suggesting that domestic suppliers benefit from contacts with multinational customers. But the opposite is true for fully-owned foreign affiliates, which appear to have a negative effect on domestic firms in upstream industries. These results are consistent with the observation that foreign investors entering a host country through greenfield projects are less likely to source locally than those engaged in joint ventures or partial acquisitions. They are also in line with the evidence suggesting that fully-owned foreign subsidiaries use newer or more sophisticated technologies than jointly-owned investment projects, and thus may have higher requirements which only a few, if any, domestic suppliers are able to meet.",

            "abstract": "Infrastructure industries and services are crucial for generating economic growth, alleviating poverty, and increasing international competitiveness. Safe water is essential for life, and health. Reliable electricity saves businesses and consumers from having to invest in expensive backup systems, or more costly alternatives, and keeps rural women and children from having to spend long hours fetching firewood. Widely available and affordable telecommunications and transportation services can foster grassroots entrepreneurship, and thus are critical to generating employment, and advancing economic development. In most developing and transition economies, private participation in infrastructure, and restructuring have been driven by the high costs, and poor performance of state-owned network utilities. Under state ownership, services were usually under-priced, and making it difficult to expand services. The report indicates that although privatization, competitive restructuring, and regulatory reforms improve infrastructure performance, several issues must be considered and conditions met for these measures to achieve their public interest goals. First, reforms have significantly improved performance, leading to higher investment, productivity, and service coverage and quality. Second, effective regulation-including the setting of adequate tariff levels-is the most critical enabling condition for infrastructure reform. Regulation should clarify property rights, and assure private investors that their investments will not be subject to regulatory opportunism. Third, for privatization to generate widely shared social benefits, infrastructure industries must be thoroughly restructured and able to sustain competition. Thus restructuring, to introduce competition should be done before privatization, and regulation should be in place to assure potential buyers of both competitive, and monopoly elements.",

In this review, we critically evaluate the results of the research on this topic that have emerged from disciplines, such as cognitive and social psychology, neuroscience, and cultural anthropology. We highlight some of the most important advances to have been made in our understanding of this topic: For example, research has shown that interpersonal tactile stimulation provides an effective means of influencing people's social behaviors (such as modulating their tendency to comply with requests, in affecting people's attitudes toward specific services, in creating bonds between couples or groups, and in strengthening romantic relationships), regardless of whether or not the tactile contact itself can be remembered explicitly. What is more, interpersonal touch can be used to communicate emotion in a manner similar to that demonstrated previously in vision and audition. The recent growth of studies investigating the potential introduction of tactile sensations to long-distance communication technologies (by means of mediated or 'virtual' touch) are also reviewed briefly. Finally, we highlight the synergistic effort that will be needed by researchers in different disciplines if we are to develop a more complete understanding of interpersonal touch in the years to come.",

The key messages are important for all countries-low, middle, and high income-as well as for regional and global institutions: first, institutional legitimacy is the key to stability. When state institutions do not adequately protect citizens, guard against corruption, or provide access to justice; when markets do not provide job opportunities; or when communities have lost social cohesion-the likelihood of violent conflict increases. Second, investing in citizen security, justice, and jobs is essential to reducing violence. But there are major structural gaps in our collective capabilities to support these areas. Third, confronting this challenge effectively means that institutions need to change. International agencies and partners from other countries must adapt procedures so they can respond with agility and speed, a longer-term perspective, and greater staying power. Fourth, need to adopt a layered approach. Some problems can be addressed at the country level, but others need to be addressed at a regional level, such as developing markets that integrate insecure areas and pooling resources for building capacity Fifth, in adopting these approaches, need to be aware that the global landscape is changing. Regional institutions and middle income countries are playing a larger role. This means should pay more attention to south-south and south-north exchanges, and to the recent transition experiences of middle income countries.",

            "abstract": "We argue that the global digital divide, as measured by cross-national differences in Internet use, is the result of the economic, regulatory and sociopolitical characteristics of countries and their evolution over time. We predict Internet use to increase with worldsystem status, privatization and competition in the telecommunications sector, democracy and cosmopolitanism. Using data on 118 countries from 1997 through 2001, we find relatively robust support for each of our hypotheses. We conclude by exploring the implications of this new, powerful communication medium for the global political economy and for the spread of democracy around the world. The Internet has developed unevenly throughout the world, creating what has become known as the \u201cglobal digital divide\u201d (Castells 2001; Kirkman et al. 2002; Mosaic Group 1998; Norris 2001; Rogers 2001). The number of Internet users is one of the most widely used indicators of development of this emerging medium of communication. Less than 10 percent of the world\u2019s population uses the Internet, and the gap between developed and developing countries has continued to widen since the early 1990s (see Figure 1). Differences by country are remarkable. Statistics compiled by the International Telecommunication Union as of the end of 2002 indicate that Internet use as a proportion of the population ranges from less than one percent in many underdeveloped African, Central American, and South Asian countries to between 50 and 60 percent in Iceland, the United States, Scandinavia, Singapore or South Korea (ITU 2003).1 The growth of the Internet has captured the imagination of users, policymakers, entrepreneurs, corporate managers, military strategists, social commentators, scholars, and journalists. Some early optimistic analyses envisioned the Internet as a \u201cdecentralizing, globalizing, harmonizing, and empowering\u201d medium (Negroponte 1995:229), as a new communication technology that would bring about a \u201csmaller, more open world.\u201d (Tapscott and Caston 1993:313) The most enthusiastic visionaries have argued that the Internet means the \u201ctriumph over time and space,\u201d the rise of the \u201cnetizen,\u201d and the crowning of the \u201ccustomer as sovereign\u201d (Gilder 2000). According to the cyber-optimists, the Internet can create a public sphere in Habermas\u2019s (1989) sense, one that is not regulated by the state or by commercial interests but rather owned and controlled by the participants themselves (Schneider 1996). While some of the cyber-optimists recognized the looming issue of inequality in access to the Internet (e.g. Tapscott and Caston 1993:312), it was not until the late 1990s that international organizations, governments, think tanks, and universities started to warn about the existence of a yawning digital divide, both within and across countries (e.g., U.S.",

CRTT establishes a constant bit-rate (CBR) virtual channel between the video provider and the viewer's set-top box (STB) and then transmits cells from the provider into this channel at a constant rate. Since we assume that the number of cells in a frame is variable, CRTT requires that some number of cells be built up in an STB buffer before the commencement of playback. The build up, cell transmission rate, and the set-top memory size must be chosen so that there is no starvation or overflow at the STB. We develop fundamental relationships between these parameters for viable CRTT. We then apply the theory to an MPEG encoding of Star Wars and find that the minimal STB memory far CRTT is 23 Mbytes. We also consider varying the constant rate over a small number of intervals. We find, for example, that for Star Wars approximately 2 Mbytes of set-top memory suffices with 32 constant-rate intervals.",

Applications of such a system include computer systems security, secure electronic banking, mobile phones, credit cards, secure access to buildings, health and social services. By using biometrics a person could be identified based on \"who she/he is\" rather then \"what she/he has\" (card, token, key) or \"what she/he knows\" (password, PIN). In this paper, a brief overview of biometric methods, both unimodal and multimodal, and their advantages and disadvantages, will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) has developed an objective video quality assessment system that emulates human perception. The system returns results that agree closely with quality judgements made by a large panel of viewers. Such a system is valuable because it provides broadcasters, video engineers and standards organizations with the capability for making meaningful video quality evaluations without convening viewer panels. The issue is timely because compressed digital video systems present new quality measurement questions that are largely unanswered.#R##N##R##N#The perception-based system was developed and tested for a broad range of scenes and video technologies. The 36 test scenes contained widely varying amounts of spatial and temporal information. The 27 impairments included digital video compression systems operating at line rates from 56 kbits/sec to 45 Mbits/sec with controlled error rates, NTSC encode/decode cycles, VHS and S-VHS record/play cycles, and VHF transmission. Subjective viewer ratings of the video quality were gathered in the ITS subjective viewing laboratory that conforms to CCIR Recommendation 500-3. Objective measures of video quality were extracted from the digitally sampled video. These objective measurements are designed to quantify the spatial and temporal distortions perceived by the viewer.#R##N##R##N##R##N#This paper presents the following: a detailed description of several of the best ITS objective measurements, a perception-based model that predicts subjective ratings from these objective measurements, and a demonstration of the correlation between the model's predictions and viewer panel ratings. A personal computer-based system is being developed that will implement these objective video quality measurements in real time. These video quality measures are being considered for inclusion in the Digital Video Teleconferencing Performance Standard by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Accredited Standards Committee T1, Working Group T1A1.5.",

Various definitions of interactivity exist in the literature, alternately focusing on the participants, structure and technology. The PLS TXT UR Thoughts research project builds on existing definitions to define interactivity as a message loop originating from and concluding with the student. The authors chose to introduce mobile phones and short message service (SMS) within the classroom due to the ubiquity of mobile phones among students and the interactive potential of SMS. SMS is a low-threshold application used widely by students to quickly send concise, text-based messages at any time. The research presented involved students sending SMS in real-time, in class, via their personal mobile phones. Using a modem interfacing with customised software to produce SMS files, the lecturer can view the messages and verbally develop the interactive loop with students during class. The SMS are available online after class, allowing interactive loops to further develop via threaded comments.",

This paper presents a unified view of several recently proposed algorithms for handling this class of optimization problems, placing them in a common majorization-minimization (MM) framework. One of the classes of algorithms considered (when using quadratic bounds on nondifferentiable log-priors) shares the infamous ?singularity issue? (SI) of ?iteratively re weighted least squares? (IRLS) algorithms: the possibility of having to handle infinite weights, which may cause both numerical and convergence issues. In this paper, we prove several new results which strongly support the claim that the SI does not compromise the usefulness of this class of algorithms. Exploiting the unified MM perspective, we introduce a new algorithm, resulting from using bounds for nonconvex regularizers; the experiments confirm the superior performance of this method, when compared to the one based on quadratic majorization. Finally, an experimental comparison of the several algorithms, reveals their relative merits for different standard types of scenarios.",

The authors address three questions: 1) What impact do specific policy changes-relating to ownership and competition-have on sectoral performance? 2) How is the impact of change in any one policy affected by the implementation of the other, and by the overall regulatory framework? 3) Does the sequence in which reforms are implemented affect performance? The authors find that both privatization and competition lead to significant improvements in performance. But a comprehensive reform program, involving both policies and the support of an independent regulator, produced the largest gains-an 8 percent higher level of mainlines and a 21 percent higher level of productivity compared to years of partial and no reform. Interestingly, the sequence of reform matters: mainline penetration is lower if competition is introduced after privatization, rather than at the same time. The authors also find that autonomous factors, such as technological progress, have a strong influence on telecommunications performance, accounting for an increase of 5 percent a year in teledensity and 9 percent in productivity over the period 1985 to 1999.",

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the most relevant research activities for minimizing energy consumption in telecom networks, with a specific emphasis on those employing optical technologies. We investigate the energy-minimization opportunities enabled by optical technologies and classify the existing approaches over different network domains, namely core, metro, and access networks. A section is also devoted to describe energy-efficient solutions for some of today's important applications using optical network technology, e.g., grid computing and data centers. We provide an overview of the ongoing standardization efforts in this area. This work presents a comprehensive and timely survey on a growing field of research, as it covers most aspects of energy consumption in optical telecom networks.

In order to do so, the paper presents a functional framework which analyses handheld application in relation to their use as well as the pedagogical underpinning, if any, that informs their development. Our framework currently consists of seven distinct categories of application, which we term: administrative, referential, interactive, microworld, data collection, location aware and collaborative. We argue that three categories, namely data collection, location aware and collaborative, are particularly suited to learning with handheld devices when they are informed by collaborative, contextual and constructionist learning theories. Furthermore, we contend that applications of the type just outlined deserve further research since they are not attempting to replicate, or even augment, existing learning scenarios but rather they try to create new learning opportunities which would not be possible without (mobile) technology. Finally, the authors introduce a number of applications and learning scenarios that they have developed for handheld devices and explain their position within the framework.",

The authors examine why these costs are so high in some countries, and, quantify the importance of two explanations: restrictive trade policies, and private anti-competitive practices. Both matter, they find, but private anti-competitive practices have the greater impact. Trade liberalization, and the breakup of private carrier agreements, would lead to a reduction in average liner transport prices of a third, and cost savings of up to $ 3 billion on goods carried to the United States alone. The policy implications are clear: not only should government policy be further liberalized, but there should be stronger international disciplines on restrictive business practices. The authors propose developing such disciplines in the current round of services negotiations at the World Trade Organization.",
