            "abstract": "An autonomous UGV is essentially an autonomous UGV that operates without the need for a human controller. The vehicle uses its sensors to develop some limited understanding of the environment, which is then used by control algorithms to determine the next action to take in the context of a human provided mission goal. This fully eliminates the need for any human to watch over the menial tasks that the UGV is completing. Existing systems do not include the environmental information assessment, object identification, self protection against high temperature and the implementation with most advanced hardware and related software algorithm. This project presents the development of an unmanned ground vehicle with the facility of measurement of humidity, temperature and illumination, video and audio clips to get the information of the environment through which UGV navigates. The project also discusses the real time embedded implementation of this obstacle mapping system on a small Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to support real time obstacle avoidance, object identification by image processing and proposes self protection against high temperature. These activities are a part of a larger effort to establish a theoretical foundation for autonomous and cooperative multi-UxV guidance solutions in adversarial environments.",

This paper gives an overview about UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) systems and their application for photogrammetric recording and documentation of cultural heritage. First the historical development of UAV systems and the definition of UAV-helicopte rs will be given. The advantages of a photogrammetric system on-board a model helicopter will be briefly discussed and compared to standard aerial and terrestrial photogrammetry. UAVs are mostly low cost systems and flexible and therefore a suitable alternative solution compared to other mobile mapping systems. A mini UAV-system was used for photogrammetric image data acquisition near Palpa in Peru. A settlement from the 13 th century AD, which was presumably used as a mine, was flown with a model helicopter. Based on the image data, an accurate 3D-model will be generated in the future. With an orthophoto and a DEM derived from aerial images in a scale of 1:7 000, a flight planning was build up. The determined flying positions were implemented in the flight control system. Thus, the helicopter is able to fly to predefined pathpoints automatically. Tests in Switzerland and the flights in Pinchango Alto showed that using the built-in GPS/INS- and stabilization units of the flight control system, predefined positions could be reached exactly to acquire the images. The predicted strip crossings and flying height were kept accurately in the autonomous flying mode.",

Focus on operational usefulness of these systems highlights inadequacies in current command and control designs. Current systems require two operators to control a single unmanned vehicle (UV), however future concepts indicate requirements for single operator control of multiple UV\u2019s. The control problem is amplified when UV\u2019s are considered as force multipliers for combat manned systems, such as on the DARPA UCAR program. In this case operators in high workload environments are asked to bear the burden of the additional tasks required to control UV\u2019s. Recent studies indicate that operators are unable to accommodate UV control with current design paradigms because of the significant increase in workload. Technologies such as autonomous behavior capabilities, innovative human machine interface (HMI) concepts, and networked dissemination of data offer potential components for the solution to UV control. The promise of autonomous systems brings with it a new problem that must be addressed, that of maintaining operator situational awareness. The purpose of this paper is to review the challenges that confront UV designs as they evolve to a single/operator/multiple vehicle paradigm.",

Among UAS, promising characteristics are long flight duration, improved mission safety, flight repeatability due to improving autopilots, and reduced operational costs when compared to manned aircraft. The potential advantages of an unmanned platform, however, depend on many factors, such as aircraft, sensor types, mission objectives, and the current UAS regulatory requirements for operations of the particular platform. The regulations concerning UAS operation are still in the early development stages and currently present significant barriers to entry for scientific users. In this article we describe a variety of platforms, as well as sensor capabilities, and identify advantages of each as relevant to the demands of users in the scientific research sector. We also briefly discuss the current state of regulations affecting UAS operations, with the purpose of informing the scientific community about this developing technology whose potential for revolutionizing natural science observations is similar to those transformations that GIS and GPS brought to the community two decades ago.",

Among UAS, promising characteristics are long flight duration, improved mission safety, flight repeatability due to improving autopilots, and reduced operational costs when compared to manned aircraft. The potential advantages of an unmanned platform, however, depend on many factors, such as aircraft, sensor types, mission objectives, and the current UAS regulatory requirements for operations of the particular platform. The regulations concerning UAS operation are still in the early development stages and currently present significant barriers to entry for scientific users. In this article we describe a variety of platforms, as well as sensor capabilities, and identify advantages of each as relevant to the demands of users in the scientific research sector. We also briefly discuss the current state of regulations affecting UAS operations, with the purpose of informing the scientific community about this developing technology whose potential for revolutionizing natural science observations is similar to those transformations that GIS and GPS brought to the community two decades ago.",

In this paper, a potential field-based method is proposed for UGV navigation in such scenarios. In the proposed approach, a potential field is generated in the two-dimensional \u201ctrajectory space\u201d of the UGV path curvature and longitudinal velocity. In contrast to traditional potential field methods, dynamic constraints and the effect of changing terrain conditions can be easily expressed in the proposed framework. A maneuver is chosen within a set of performance bounds, based on the local potential field gradient. It is shown that the proposed method is subject to local maxima problems, rather than local minima. A simple randomization technique is proposed to address this problem. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method can successfully navigate a small UGV between predefined waypoints at speeds up to 7.0 m/s, while avoiding static hazards. Further, vehicle curvature and velocity are controlled during vehicle motion to avoid rollover and excessive side slip. The method is computationally efficient, and thus suitable for onboard real-time implementation.",

The vehicle uses its sensors to develop some limited understanding of the environment, which is then used by control algorithms to determine the next action to take in the context of a human provided mission goal. This fully eliminates the need for any human to watch over the menial tasks that the UGV is completing. Existing systems do not include the environmental information assessment, object identification, self protection against high temperature and the implementation with most advanced hardware and related software algorithm. This project presents the development of an unmanned ground vehicle with the facility of measurement of humidity, temperature and illumination, video and audio clips to get the information of the environment through which UGV navigates. The project also discusses the real time embedded implementation of this obstacle mapping system on a small Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to support real time obstacle avoidance, object identification by image processing and proposes self protection against high temperature. These activities are a part of a larger effort to establish a theoretical foundation for autonomous and cooperative multi-UxV guidance solutions in adversarial environments.",

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is currently undertaking a comprehensive overhaul of the National Airspace System (NAS) known as Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). NextGen will include increased automation systems for both terminal and en-route Air Traffic Control (ATC). Improvements in two-way data communication links between aircraft and ATC will facilitate the use of such automation systems. The robust integration of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into NextGen automation systems is an integral component to meeting the far-term (2018+) NextGen vision. By determining how UAS flight operations and protocols may be different than those of traditional manned aircraft, informed decisions can be made concerning the data and interfaces required to accommodate routine UAS operations by NextGen automation systems, ultimately leading to safer and more efficient integration of UAS into non-segregated civil airspace. This paper describes many of the challenges associated with such accommodation as well as proposed solutions to address these challenges based upon construction of prototype interfaces using established UAS communication standards and envisioned ATC automation interfaces. Enhanced data formats, communication protocols and algorithms are also researched and discussed.",

Either soft (airfoil) or rigid (delta, rokkaku) kites may be utilized in wind ranging from 10 to 40 km/h. Various film, digital, or video imaging devices are employed in single- or dual-camera rigs for acquiring individual images, multiband photos, or stereopairs. Camera pan, tilt, and shutter are operated by radio control from the ground. Photographs may be obtained in visible and near-infrared portions of the spectrum using different film/filter combinations. Photographs can be taken in any position--vertical, low- and high-oblique, and in any orientation relative to the sun and ground object. Vertical digital KAP typically has pixel resolution of 5-10 cm, and about \u00bd to 1 hectare ground area is depicted in a single scene. Kite aerial photography is highly portable and can be operated in almost any situation with an open flying field. A crew of two is sufficient normally, one to fly the kite, the other to operate radio controls and take pictures. Low cost makes this method feasible for routine operation by small organizations, and the method is convenient for frequent photography to document environmental changes. We have utilized kite aerial photography for diverse research and commercial applications including assessment of forests and wetlands, investigations of fluvial and glacial landforms, depiction of multiview -angle reflectance phenomena, and surveys of property and construction sites. KAP has proven valuable for bridging the scale and resolution gap between ground observations and conventional airphotos and satellite images.",

Whilst remaining a device for both the hobbyist and aircraft-enthusiast to enjoy, they are now also used for carrying out activities such as law enforcement surveillance, agricultural maintenance, acquiring specialist movie and sports event footage along with search and seizure activities. Conversely, despite maintaining many legitimate uses, there are also increasing media reports of unmanned aerial vehicle technology being abused, ranging from physical assaults due to negligent flights to breaches of Civil Aviation Authority Air Navigation Regulations, requiring a forensic analysis of these devices in order to establish the chain of events. This article presents an introductory discussion of unmanned aerial vehicle analysis and provides the results of a digital forensic investigation of a test Parrot Bebop unmanned aerial vehicle. Directions for the acquisition and analysis of the device's internal storage are provided along with an interpretation of on-board flight data, captured media and operating system. Further, as the device can be controlled via Android and iOS devices using the application FreeFlight3, forensic analysis of these devices is also presented. Results showed the ability to recover flight data from both the unmanned aerial vehicle and controller handsets along with captured media, however problems exist with establishing the definitive owner of the device, particularly if a user had abandoned it at the scene of a crime.",

And the resulting nonlinear equation of motion consists of 6-DOF air vehicle dynamics as well as the rotor flapping and engine torque equations. A simulation model was modified using the existing simulator for an unmanned helicopter dynamic model, which reflects the unmanned test helicopter(CNUHELI). The dynamic response of the refined model was compared with the flight test data. It can be shown that a good coincidence was accomplished between the real unmanned helicopter system and the mathematical model. This dynamic model was linearized for classical controller design using small perturbation method. A Neuro-PD control system was designed for both longitudinal and lateral flight modes, and the results were compared with the PD-only control response.

They must have the ability to determine whether the current terrain is traversable or not by using onboard sensors. This paper explores new methods related to environment perception based on computer image processing, pattern recognition, multisensors data fusion, and multidisciplinary theory. Kalman filter is used for low-level fusion of physical level, thus using the D-S evidence theory for high-level data fusion. Probability Test and Gaussian Mixture Model are proposed to obtain the traversable region in the forward-facing camera view for UGV. One feature set including color and texture information is extracted from areas of interest and combined with a classifier approach to resolve two types of terrain (traversable or not). Also, three-dimension data are employed; the feature set contains components such as distance contrast of three-dimension data, edge chain-code curvature of camera image, and covariance matrix based on the principal component method. This paper puts forward one new method that is suitable for distributing basic probability assignment (BPA), based on which D-S theory of evidence is employed to integrate sensors information and recognize the obstacle. The subordination obtained by using the fuzzy interpolation is applied to calculate the basic probability assignment. It is supposed that the subordination is equal to correlation coefficient in the formula. More accurate results of object identification are achieved by using the D-S theory of evidence. Control on motion behavior or autonomous navigation for UGV is based on the method, which is necessary for UGV high speed driving in cross-country environment. The experiment results have demonstrated the viability of the new method.",

This paper describes the application of CIFER' system identification techniques, which have been developed for full size helicopters, to this aircraft. An accurate, high-bandwidth, linear state-space model was derived for the hover condition. The model structure includes the explicit representation of regressive rotor-flap dynamics, rigid-body fuselage dynamics, and the yaw damper. The R-50 codiguration and identified dynamics are compared with those of a dynamically scaled UH-1H. The identified model shows excellent predictive capability and is well suited for flight control design and simulation applications.",

Next, we define potential agricultural applications where autonomous UAVs can be used, like monitoring of crops and animals, but also controlling field robots and performing management actions. Before this becomes reality in the complex agricultural domain, significant work has to be done both by research and technology providers, especially in the field of autonomous decision making, so as to allow safe and reliable autonomous operation.",

Industry has developed software apps for smart phones and tablets that allows soldiers to not only pilot unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) but to share and receive intelligence and reconnaissance videos and images remotely from the ground control station (GCS) or directly from the UAV. The Department of Defense has not developed a secure communication network that will support a large quantity of smart devices, nor certification, standards or policies for operation of secure smart devices. Therefore, mission critical information will be shared through unsecured, mobile and wireless networks and through unclassified, unsecure smart technology that are vulnerable to cyber security risks. Lack of security of the mobile and wireless networks and smart devices could result in the unintentional sharing of data as well as loss of control of the UAV to enemies. The Department of Defense has failed to develop a threat model and risk assessment to identify the cyber security threats and ensure the proper security countermeasures are in place. This paper will analyze the cyber security vulnerabilities within the communication links, smart devices hardware, specifically smart phones and tablets, and software applications to develop a risk model of the threat profile of the GCS networking hub. This model will help designers and users of the military and civilian UAV communities to understand the threat profile of the GCS networking hub to develop a secure communication network based upon the vulnerabilities identified for smart phones and tablets.",

During 2002 and 2003, we used a 1.5-m wingspan UAV equipped with autonomous control and sophisticated video equipment to test the potential usefulness of such an aircraft for wildlife research applications in Florida, USA. The UAV we used completed >30 missions (missions averaging 13 km linear distance covered) over 2 years before finally crashing due to engine failure.

Quad-rotor helicopters consist of  two pairs of counter rotating rotors situated at the ends of  a  cross, symmetric about the centre of  gravity, which coincides with the origin of  the reference system used. These rotors provide  the predominant  aerodynamic forces which act on the rotorcraft, and are modelled using momentum theory as well as blade element theory. From this, one can determine the expected payload capacity and lift performance of the rotorcraft. The Euler-Lagrange method has been used to derive the defining equations of  motion of  the six degree-of-freedom system. The Lagrangian was obtained by modelling the kinetic and potential energy of  the system and the external forces obtained from the aerodynamic analysis. Based on this model, a control strategy was developed using linear PD controllers. A numerical simulation was then conducted using MATLAB\u00ae Simulink\u00ae. First, the derived model was simulated to investigate the behaviour of  the rotorcraft, and then a second investigation was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the implemented control system. The results and findings of these investigations are then presented and discussed.",

Inshore areas are where ocean and land intersect; the sea conditions and environment are complex and changeable, and human activities are frequent in these areas. Natural disasters, such as a substantial rise in sea levels, coastal erosion and transitions, and rapid flooding from tsunamis, and human development projects, pollution, and ecological damage must be thoroughly investigated, monitored, recorded, and prevented. The west coast of Taiwan, particularly the southeast coastal plain, is a highly populated narrow area; thus, field survey tools with a high degree of freedom and flexible applications are required for data collection to reach its full potential. The Taiwan Ocean Research Institute developed an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) for the \u201cLong Term Observation for Research Performed in TORI\u201d 2010 project. This USV is a platform that integrates scientific equipment, including Wi-Fi communication and a satellite-based global positioning system (GPS) with navigation images and signals, to form an internal network with onshore control bases to allow the instant acquisition of measured data and enable researchers to conduct surveys in safe conditions. USVs are appropriate for various types of inshore research and surveys, such as marine topography, sediment disposition analysis, inshore engineering measurements, and the monitoring of hydrology, water quality, and the environment. One aim of the Taiwan Ocean Research Institute (TORI) is to establish a method to use the USV for collecting inshore marine topography, hydrology, water quality, and meteorological data. Integrating field investigations of Taiwan\u2019s coastal waters will provide data for verifying numerical simulations and lead scientists to explore novel and unknown areas.",

Compared with piloted aircraft, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can focus on small crop fields at lower flight altitudes than regular aircraft to perform site-specific farm management with higher precision.  They can also fill in the gap in locations where fixed winged or rotary winged aircraft are not readily available.  In agriculture, UAVs have primarily been developed and used for remote sensing and application of crop production and protection materials.  Application of fertilizers and chemicals is frequently needed at specific times and locations for site-specific management.  Routine monitoring of crop plant health is often required at very high resolution for accurate site-specific management as well.  This paper presents an overview of research involving the development of UAV technology for agricultural production management.  Technologies, systems and methods are examined and studied.  The limitations of current UAVs for agricultural production management are discussed, as well as future needs and suggestions for development and application of the UAV technologies in agricultural production management.",

The task of persistent surveillance is different from a coverage or exploration problem, in that the target area needs to be continuously searched, minimizing the time between visitations to the same region. This difference does not allow a straightforward application of most exploration techniques to the problem, although ideas from these methods can still be used. In this research we investigate techniques that are scalable, reliable, efficient, and robust to problem dynamics. These are tested in a multiple unmanned air vehicle (UAV) simulation environment, developed for this program. A semi-heuristic control policy for a single UAV is extended to the case of multiple UAVs using two methods. One is an extension of a reactive policy for a single UAV and the other involves allocation of sub-regions to individual UAVs for parallel exploration. An optimal assignment procedure (based on auction algorithms) has also been developed for this purpose. A comparison is made between the two approaches and a simplified optimal result. The reactive policy is found to exhibit an interesting emergent behavior as the number of UAVs becomes large. The control policy derived for a single UAV is modified to account for actual aircraft dynamics (a 3 degree-of-freedom nonlinear dynamics simulation is used for this purpose) and improvements in performance are observed. Finally, we draw conclusions about the utility and efficiency of these techniques.",

            "abstract": "Unmanned Aircraft Systems require an ability to sense and avoid other air traffic to gain access to civil airspace and meet requirements in civil aviation regulations. One sense and avoid function is self separation, which requires that aircraft remain \u201cwell clear.\u201d An approach is proposed in this paper to treat well clear as a separation standard, thus posing it as a relative state between aircraft where the risk of collision first reaches an unacceptable level. By this approach, an analytically-derived boundary for well clear can be derived that supports rigorous safety assessment. A preliminary boundary is proposed in both time and distance for the well clear separation standard, and recommendations for future work are made. I. Introduction NE key challenge to achieving airspace access for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) is the ability to provide an acceptably safe means of compliance with federal aviation regulations that require pilots to see and avoid other aircraft. Without a pilot onboard the aircraft, UAS must utilize operational or technical means to detect and resolve potential conflicts. Several efforts are ongoing with the goal of defining required performance of sense and avoid functions. There have been recent recommendations in the U.S. 1 and internationally 2 to define the sense and avoid function as being composed of two separate functions: self separation and collision avoidance. Self separation is execution of maneuvers to remain \u201cwell clear\u201d of other aircraft. These maneuvers would typically be gentle, right-of-way compliant maneuvers well in advance of a serious conflict. Collision avoidance would be a function executed to prevent an imminent collision, typically through more aggressive maneuvers. The requirement to maintain well clear derives from regulatory language in U.S. Federal Aviation Regulations governing general flight rules. The language is insufficient to derive a quantitative performance requirement to serve as guidance for algorithm design and system evaluation. An analytical approach to defining a well clear threshold to evaluate self-separation performance is proposed in this paper. This analytical definition can be used as one component of guidance for an acceptable means for UAS to comply with the intent of FAR Part 91 governing sense",

Recently, unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have become more available for numerous civilian applications. The use of small drones for wildlife surveys as a surrogate for manned aerial surveys is becoming increasingly attractive and has already been implemented with some success. This raises the question of how to process UAS imagery in order to determine the surface area of sampling strips within an acceptable confidence level. For the purpose of wildlife surveys, the estimation of sampling strip surface area needs to be both accurate and quick, and easy to implement. As GPS and an inertial measurement units are commonly integrated within unmanned aircraft platforms, two methods of direct georeferencing were compared here. On the one hand, we used the image footprint projection (IFP) method, which utilizes collinearity equations on each image individually. On the other hand, the Structure from Motion (SfM) technique was used for block orientation and georeferencing. These two methods were compared on eight sampling strips. An absolute orientation of the strip was determined by indirect georeferencing using ground control points. This absolute orientation was considered as the reference and was used for validating the other two methods. The IFP method was demonstrated to be the most accurate and the easiest to implement. It was also found to be less demanding in terms of image quality and overlap. However, even though a flat landscape is the type most widely encountered in wildlife surveys in Africa, we recommend estimating IFP sensitivity at an accentuation of the relief.",

The agents will be organized in clusters in order to carry out such missions; different clusters may execute different missions simultaneously. During the mission, the unmanned agents are supported by sensors on the ground and in the air, and can receive commands and send information back to a command ship, say. It is clear that efficient communications between agents, and from agents to sensors and to command posts are critical to mission success. The goal of the Minuteman project is to develop the concept and initial prototype of an agile, dynamic, multi-layer \"Internet in the sky\" architecture that can deliver the \"forward power\" of the unmanned missions. The architecture consists of a high speed, wireless mobile backbone network (MBN) - with point-to-point wireless links. and local access networks feeding to backbone nodes. The design is extremely challenging because of the hostile environment, the need for QoS support and the unpredictable nature of the requirements. The focus of this paper is on scalable addressing and routing in such a multiplayer mobile environment where UAVs can fly at speeds exceeding several hundreds miles per hour. We exploit the fact that agents typically move in groups, and achieve scalability by keeping track of a \"landmark\" for each group. This is done using LANMAR, a land-mark ad hoc routing scheme. The LANMAR scheme originally developed for \"flat\" ad hoc networks extends naturally to a network with a physical backbone. Via simulation we show that LANMAR maintains robust, resilient. rapidly restored connectivity in the face of agent mobility.",

These rotors provide  the predominant  aerodynamic forces which act on the rotorcraft, and are modelled using momentum theory as well as blade element theory. From this, one can determine the expected payload capacity and lift performance of the rotorcraft. The Euler-Lagrange method has been used to derive the defining equations of  motion of  the six degree-of-freedom system. The Lagrangian was obtained by modelling the kinetic and potential energy of  the system and the external forces obtained from the aerodynamic analysis. Based on this model, a control strategy was developed using linear PD controllers. A numerical simulation was then conducted using MATLAB\u00ae Simulink\u00ae. First, the derived model was simulated to investigate the behaviour of  the rotorcraft, and then a second investigation was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the implemented control system.

A simple casualty expectation model is presented and is applied to the example case-study scenario of a generic Medium Altitude, Long Endurance (MALE) UAS on approach to Royal Australia Air Force (RAAF) Base Edinburgh.  A brief evaluation of the results from the analysis is provided; illustrating how a formal risk analysis can be used to inform practical decision making. The paper concludes by providing a summary on the direction of the program of research and the key points made.",

A surveillance system is one of the critical components of detect-and-avoid systems in order to predict potential conicts with adequate lead time to remain \\well clear\" of other aircraft. The performance requirements of surveillance systems to detect and track intruder aircraft will depend on the encounter geometries that unmanned aircraft are expected to have with other aircraft in the airspace. In this study, a database of unmitigated encounters between unmanned aircraft and conventional manned aircraft operating under visual ight rules is created without maneuvering any aircraft to mitigate the risk of a separation violation. The encounter database is built through fasttime simulation of a large number of unmanned aircraft conducting various missions in the presence of historical visual ight rules trac as recorded from live airspace operations. Analysis of the resulting encounter geometries suggests how the overall safety and performance of a surveillance system may relate to surveillance parameters such as surveillance range, horizontal and vertical elds or regard. This paper proposed and investigated potential safety and performance metrics for evaluating the performance of a surveillance system, such as the ratio of undetected and late-detected separation violations, and the time to violation at rst detection for given sets of surveillance parameters. These example metrics demonstrate the utility of the database of encounters created in this work. It is expected that this database will be useful in the derivation of surveillance system requirements for detect-and-avoid systems.",

            "abstract": "Abstract#R##N#Large areas of tropical lands are being removed from agriculture and restored to address conservation goals. However, monitoring the ecological value of these efforts at the individual land-owner scale is rare, owing largely to issues of cost and accessibility. Traditional field-based measures for assessing forest recovery and habitat quality can be labour intensive and costly. Here we assess whether remote sensing measurements from lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are a cost-effective substitute for traditional field measures. An inexpensive UAV-based remote sensing methodology, \u201cEcosynth\u201d, was applied to measure forest canopy structure across field plots in a 7\u20139-yr tropical forest restoration study in southern Costa Rica. Ecosynth methods combine aerial images from consumer-grade digital cameras with computer vision software to generate 3D \u2018point cloud\u2019 models of vegetation at high spatial resolutions. Ecosynth canopy structure measurements were compared to field-based measures and their ability to predict the abundance of frugivorous birds; key seed dispersers that are sensitive to canopy structure. Ecosynth canopy height measurements were highly correlated with field-based measurements (R2\u00a0\u2a7e\u00a00.85), a result comparable in precision to LiDAR-based remote sensing measurements. Ecosynth parameters were also strongly correlated with above-ground biomass (R2\u00a0\u2a7e\u00a00.81) and percent canopy openness (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.82). Correlations were weaker with proportion-based measures such as canopy roughness (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.53). Several Ecosynth metrics (e.g., canopy openness and height) predicted frugivore presence and abundance at levels of accuracy similar to those of field-based measurements. Ecosynth UAV remote-sensing provides an effective alternate methodology to traditional field-based measures of evaluating forest structure and complexity across landscapes. Furthermore, given the volume of data that can be generated in a single flight plan, as well as the ability to use the technology in remote areas, these methods could expand the scope of studies on forest dynamics and recovery when combined with field-based calibration plots.",

            "abstract": "Traditional manned airborne surveys are usually exp ensive and the resolution of the acquired images is often limited. The main advantage of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system acting as a photogrammetric sensor platform over more traditional manned airborne system is the high flexibility that allows image acquisition from unconventional viewpoints, the low cost in comparison with classical aerial photogrammetry and the high r esolution images obtained. Nowadays there is a nece ssity for surveying small areas and in these cases, it is not economical the use of normal large format aerial or metric cameras to acquire aerial photos, therefore, the use of UAV platforms can be very sui table. Also the large availability of digital camer as has strongly enhanced the capabilities of UAVs. The use of digital non metric cameras together with the UAV could be used for multiple applications such as aerial surveys, GIS, wildfire mapping, stability of landslides, crop monitoring, etc. The aim of this work was to develop a low cost and accurate methodology in the production of ortho photos and Digital Elevation Models (DEM). The study was conducted in the province of Almeria, south of Spain. The photogrammetric flight had an altitude of 50 m over ground, c overing an area of 5.000 m 2 approximately. The UAV used in this work was the md4-200, which is an electronic battery powered quadr ocopter UAV developed by Microdrones GmbH, Germany. It had on-board a Pextax Optio A40 digital non metric camera with 12 Megapixels. It features a 3x optical zoom lens with a focal range covering an gles of view equivalent to those of 37-111 mm lens in 35 mm format. The quadrocopter can be programmed to follow a route defined by several waypoints and actions and it has t he ability for vertical take off and landing. Proper flight geometry during image ac quisition is essential in order to minimize the num ber of photographs, avoid areas without a good coverage and make the overlaps homogeneous. The flight planning was done using the MdCockpit software, with the module waypoint editor. Flight route file was downloaded into the quadrocopter autonomous chip via cable. A total of twelve vertical images with a longitudinal and tran sversal overlapping of 60 % and 50 % respectively were taken. The digital camera was previously geometrically calibrated. Field cont rol points covering the whole studied area were def ined over the area of interest and their coordinates were measured by a GPS. Natural targets were used as field control points. The c lose range photogrammetric software Photomodeler Scanner v.7 was used in this work to calibrate the camera and to carry out the p hotogrammetric process. The software Golden Surfer was used to produce the DEM. The planimetric and the altimetric root mean squar e error (RMSE) were calculated in order to check the accuracy of the pr oducts. The RMSEx was 6 cm, the RMSEy was 4 cm and the RMSEy was 7 cm. Our preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of orthophotos and DEMs obtained from images captured from a quadrocopter using low cost photogrammetric software. A future work can be the comparison of the produ cts obtained following the route used in this study where the images are taken vertically with the products obtained with an orbi tal route where the number of images will be diminished and the photos will be ta ken oblique.",

UAVs are widely used in military operations nowadays because of their reliability, cost effectiveness and multi-functionality. The problem we posed in this paper is the weight lifting capacity of UAVs. Improvement in weight lifting capacity may leads to adding a more function in account of UAVs. To validate this proposal, we considered many different structures of UAVs and choose Quadrotor. The payload of our Quadrotor is around 4 kg which adds function of weight lifting in military operations as well as industrial applications. Calculation of aerodynamic drag-lift forces has been done. The stresses generated in the body of quadrotor is not more than 22.5 MPa in \"Box\" sectional chassis and 22.2 MPa in \"C\" Sectional chassis as per the practical testing. To validate these results, the stress analysis of two types of body of quadrotor (\"Box\" and \"C\" section) is carried out in ANSYS static structural solver. As per the Static Structural solver the stress generated are 15.4 MPa and 16.97 MPa in \"Box\" and \"C\" sectional chassis respectively. Further analysis and fabrication of model is under process.

The equipment consists of a commercial CsI detector for count rate measurement and a specially designed sampling unit for airborne radioactive particles. Field and flight tests were performed for the CsI detector in the area where  137 Cs fallout from the Chernobyl accident is 23\u201345\u00a0kBq\u00a0m \u22122 . A 3-GBq  137 Cs point source could be detected at the altitude of 50\u00a0m using a flight speed of 70\u00a0km\u00a0h \u22121  and data acquisition interval of 1\u00a0s. Respective response for  192 Ir point source is 1\u00a0GBq. During the flight, the detector reacts fast to ambient external dose rate rise of 0.1\u00a0\u03bcSv\u00a0h \u22121 , which gives for the activity concentration of  131 I less than 1\u00a0kBq\u00a0m \u22123 . Operation of the sampler equipped with different type of filters was investigated using wind-tunnel experiments and field tests with the aid of radon progeny. Air flow rate through the sampler is 0.2\u20130.7\u00a0m 3 \u00a0h \u22121  at a flight speed of 70\u00a0km\u00a0h \u22121  depending on the filter type in question.

            "abstract": "Unmanned Aircraft Systems require an ability to sense and avoid other air traffic to gain access to civil airspace and meet requirements in civil aviation regulations. One sense and avoid function is self separation, which requires that aircraft remain \u201cwell clear.\u201d An approach is proposed in this paper to treat well clear as a separation standard, thus posing it as a relative state between aircraft where the risk of collision first reaches an unacceptable level. By this approach, an analytically-derived boundary for well clear can be derived that supports rigorous safety assessment. A preliminary boundary is proposed in both time and distance for the well clear separation standard, and recommendations for future work are made. I. Introduction NE key challenge to achieving airspace access for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) is the ability to provide an acceptably safe means of compliance with federal aviation regulations that require pilots to see and avoid other aircraft. Without a pilot onboard the aircraft, UAS must utilize operational or technical means to detect and resolve potential conflicts. Several efforts are ongoing with the goal of defining required performance of sense and avoid functions. There have been recent recommendations in the U.S. 1 and internationally 2 to define the sense and avoid function as being composed of two separate functions: self separation and collision avoidance. Self separation is execution of maneuvers to remain \u201cwell clear\u201d of other aircraft. These maneuvers would typically be gentle, right-of-way compliant maneuvers well in advance of a serious conflict. Collision avoidance would be a function executed to prevent an imminent collision, typically through more aggressive maneuvers. The requirement to maintain well clear derives from regulatory language in U.S. Federal Aviation Regulations governing general flight rules. The language is insufficient to derive a quantitative performance requirement to serve as guidance for algorithm design and system evaluation. An analytical approach to defining a well clear threshold to evaluate self-separation performance is proposed in this paper. This analytical definition can be used as one component of guidance for an acceptable means for UAS to comply with the intent of FAR Part 91 governing sense",

            "abstract": "The utilization and expectations of unmanned systems is mushrooming following in the success of operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Focus on operational usefulness of these systems highlights inadequacies in current command and control designs. Current systems require two operators to control a single unmanned vehicle (UV), however future concepts indicate requirements for single operator control of multiple UV\u2019s. The control problem is amplified when UV\u2019s are considered as force multipliers for combat manned systems, such as on the DARPA UCAR program. In this case operators in high workload environments are asked to bear the burden of the additional tasks required to control UV\u2019s. Recent studies indicate that operators are unable to accommodate UV control with current design paradigms because of the significant increase in workload. Technologies such as autonomous behavior capabilities, innovative human machine interface (HMI) concepts, and networked dissemination of data offer potential components for the solution to UV control. The promise of autonomous systems brings with it a new problem that must be addressed, that of maintaining operator situational awareness. The purpose of this paper is to review the challenges that confront UV designs as they evolve to a single/operator/multiple vehicle paradigm.",

UAVs can be deployed quickly and repeatedly, are less costly and safer than piloted aircraft, and can obtain very high-resolution imagery. At the Jornada Experimental Range in New Mexico, ongoing research is aimed at determining the utility of UAVs for rangeland mapping, assessment and monitoring. Digital images of arid rangelands were acquired with two UAVs that differed in size/weight, payload capacity, flight duration, GPS guidance capability and cost. The first system was a modified model airplane equipped with GPS and able to fly along preloaded waypoints and acquire images with a digital camera. The second UAV was a BAT 3 (MLB Systems) with fully autonomous flight capability and equipped with color video and digital cameras. Both units provide a data file containing GPS and elevation for each image, but the BAT also records roll, pitch and heading data. Both systems acquired high quality, high-resolution images of approximately 5 cm ground resolution (at 150 m flying height). Because the images have a small footprint (152 m x 114 m), mosaicking is required for further image analysis. Inclusion of camera calibration parameters (lens distortion, focal length, principal point) greatly increased the accuracy of the aero triangulation process and the resulting orthophotos. Due to the greater stability of the BAT and its longer flight range, the BAT imagery is better suited for analysis of larger areas than the imagery from the model airplane. However, the model airplane offers comparable image resolution and a cost effective alternative to the larger and more expensive UAV systems. Details of both systems, image acquisition and image processing results are discussed and compared.",

To discuss this issue, the paper proposes new control architecture for UAV using RBAC (Roll Based Access Control). Generally, RBAC is applied and contributes to the security of computer systems, thus, we modified RBAC to apply to UAV control system.

We examine possibilities for detection of two tree and two herb invasive species. Our aim is to establish fast, repeatable and efficient computerassisted method of timely monitoring, reducing the costs of extensive field campaigns. For finding the best detection algorithm we test various classification approaches (object-, pixel-based and hybrid). Thanks to its flexibility and low cost, UAV enables assessing the effect of phenological stage and spatial resolution, and is most suitable for monitoring the efficiency of eradication efforts. However, several challenges exist in UAV application, such as geometrical and radiometric distortions, high amount of data to be processed and legal constrains for the UAV flight missions over urban areas (often highly invaded).

The first stage of the project involved a comprehensive literature review of existing research and evaluation of existing commercial solutions.#R##N##R##N#Existing commercial solutions such as the Gatewing X100 have proved capable in industry, however a number of limitations were identified; the most prominent being that the optical payload they carry is rigidly coupled to the airframe. As weather conditions become more adverse and wind gusts buffet aircraft, the camera\u2019s axisis no longer orthogonal relative to groundwhich ultimately reduces the quality of the data captured.#R##N##R##N#Research identified from the literature review showed that \u201cpayload stabilization increases useful data capture during banking and increases processing success rate thanks to overall more predictable photo properties.\u201d [7] In addition, \u201ceven when ordered to \u2018fly straight\u2019 over ground, deviations in roll and pitch of a few degrees occur due to turbulence and require extra image overlap pre-planned. Such overlap is costly in terms of flight time and performance worsens significantly during windy weather\u201d [7]. As such, the primary focus of this project was to design an improved imaging payload design that actively stabilized the camera.#R##N##R##N#The project started by evaluating a sub $200, open source, autopilot called the Ardupilot in a fixed wing aircraft. An appropriate camera and airframe were selected and a stabilized gimbal designed. During the project, setbacks were encountered whenCyber Technology, a company that provides \u2018UAV solutions for search and rescue operations, military support, high-end surveillance, law enforcement, environmental conservation, agricultural operations, oil & gas structural inspection operations, and cinematography/photography applications\u2019[2] showed interest and suggested that the project should instead focus on designing a surveying payload for one of their flagship products, the CyberQuad MAXI. An imaging payload was designed that satisfied all design constraints and was successfully integrated onto the CyberQuad. A flight planning parameter calculator was created and trial flights were then conducted.#R##N##R##N#The planned test methodology to evaluate the gimbal was to collect imagery of a test site, flying repeated missions with a given overlap first with gimbal stabilization enabled and then again with the stabilization disabled such that the gimbal remained fixed.#R##N##R##N#By contracting licensed surveyors to conduct a conventional surveyof the test site, using their data as an absolute reference, it was planned that the imagery captured could be processed using photogrammetric software and any improvements due to stabilization be quantified.#R##N##R##N#Unfortunately the data from the ground control survey was not provided in time to be used forprocessing; however the gimbal did improve image acquisition. Further, in partnership with the aforementioned surveying company, a commercial test flight wasconducted at Kwinana Bulk Terminal surveying an iron-ore stockpile with industry grade models generated as a result.#R##N##R##N#Development of the project will continue beyond the submission of this thesis and it is hoped that the survey data can be obtained and used for processing. This should definitively prove one of the original hypotheses of the research; using a stabilized gimbal allows for more efficient flight plans as a lower level of overlap is required. Additionally, the data generated from processing should allow an estimated function of overlap vs. model accuracy to be determined allowing future flight plans to be optimized.",

Since vegetation is isolated to the coastal fringe and climatic records only extend back 50 years, with limited spatial resolution, we urgently need new proxies to determine if coastal climate has changed over the past century. In a manner similar to trees, old growth mosses also preserve a climate record along their shoots. Our ability to accurately date these mosses and map their extent in sufficient spatial detail means that, for the first time, mosses can be used as sentinels to provide crucial information on how the Antarctic coastal climate has changed over past centuries and how biota has responded to these changes. #R##N##R##N#The spatial scale of the moss beds (tens of m2) makes satellite imagery (even very high resolution imagery of 0.5 m) unsuitable for mapping their extent in sufficient detail. Due to logistical constraints aerial photography is impractical. Recent developments in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for remote sensing applications provide exciting new opportunities for ultra-high resolution mapping and monitoring of the environment. In this study, we developed a UAV consisting of a remote controlled helicopter carrying three different cameras: visible colour, near-infrared, and thermal infrared for cost-effective, efficient, and ultra-high resolution mapping of terrestrial vegetation in the Windmill Islands, Antarctica. These three sensors allow us to map different physical characteristics of the moss beds at resolutions of several centimetres.

This article presents an introductory discussion of unmanned aerial vehicle analysis and provides the results of a digital forensic investigation of a test Parrot Bebop unmanned aerial vehicle. Directions for the acquisition and analysis of the device's internal storage are provided along with an interpretation of on-board flight data, captured media and operating system. Further, as the device can be controlled via Android and iOS devices using the application FreeFlight3, forensic analysis of these devices is also presented. Results showed the ability to recover flight data from both the unmanned aerial vehicle and controller handsets along with captured media, however problems exist with establishing the definitive owner of the device, particularly if a user had abandoned it at the scene of a crime.",

            "abstract": "Most of the unmanned air vehicles (UAV) were developed with military purposes and freely used without any regulatory concerns. UAVs are expected to be used at the commercial applications in near future. The noise generation mechanism of conventional aircrafts, reduction techniques and regulatory goals are outlined in the paper. Similarly, the noise generation and control for the UAVs are discussed. Study, indicated that future studies are needed to control the noise of UAVs better and regulatory involvement is essential to keep their impact minimum on human health and environment. I. INTRODUCTION Unmanned air vehicles (UAV) have been used for many tasks including surveillance, reconnaissance, target acquisition, relaying communications, delivering small items, working as decoy and many others. Any size UAV including the nano, micro, mini through large UAVs should be well designed and properly configured to perform the assigned tasks. The structure, aerodynamic profile, electromechanical components, sensors, power source, computers, propulsion system and other components have been selected by considering mainly the required payload, operational distance, altitude and speed. The aero-acoustics of the UAVs has been gaining importance with the maturity of the available UAVs. To give them system stealth feature or not to disturb people while operating at the populated areas, the aero-acoustic of the propulsion system should be carefully studied. The length, wingspan, payload, weight, endurance, cruise speed are carefully selected during the design stage of the UaVs [1]. Most of the existing propulsion systems of UaVs were initially designed by considering the basic operation conditions including the dimensions, weight, flight distance, altitude, atmospheric conditions and operation time. They may use electrical motor(s), internal combustion engine(s) (piston engine, Wankel), turbines such as Turboprop, turbojet, turbofan, propfan), rocket(s), Pulse/Scram/Motor/Ram \u2010jets. Fuel cell(s) or solar panels may be used to generate the electricity during the operation of the system. The electrically powered UaVs are usually powered by (a) batteries (good for small size aircrafts due to the weight versus energy density), (b) fuel cells (good for high altitude UaVs due to their high effective energy density), (c) Solar cells (good for very light aircrafts, for long endurance flies, with simple missions in calm and sunny weather conditions).",

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 56 (Proceedings of the 10th International Coastal Symposium), pg \u2013 pg. Lisbon, Portugal, ISBN (Leave the number of pages blank) In the last decade we have witnessed an unprecedented development of Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) for missions with high societal impact. Future generations of UAV systems will reflect the major current trends: increased levels of autonomy, lower cost, longer endurance, and networking capabilities. Networking is one of the major trends for unmanned vehicle systems; it is also one of the enabling technologies for distributed cooperation (and computation). In mobile network systems, vehicles, sensors and operators interact through (inter-operated) communication networks. Dynamic networks of UAVs can be used in a broad range of missions like border patrol, tracking of pollution at sea, and oceanographic and environmental research. The Portuguese Air Force Academy and the School of Engineering at Porto University have been collaborating, since 2006, on the design, implementation and testing of different types of UAVs to demonstrate these technologies in a wide spectrum of military/civil missions. This is a multi-disciplinary cooperation encompassing several technological fields: advanced vision systems for identification and tracking of fixed and mobile features, cooperative control of teams of UAVs in mixed-initiative environments, sensor fusion and navigation systems. These technologies are being developed and integrated into UAV platforms for demonstration in military missions like reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition, and also in several civil missions like aerial gravimetry, aerial photography, surveillance and control of maritime traffic, fishing surveillance, and detection and control of coastal hazards. This paper reports on these developments and on the demonstrations that took place in the last two years. We report on video surveillance and environmental monitoring operations with six different types of fixed-wing UAVs (wingspans ranging from 1 to 6 meters), with autonomous take-off and landing capabilities. The smaller platforms can be easily deployed (hand-launched) while the others are more suitable for endurance and larger payloads.",

The motivation and driving force behind this has been to find new and novel ways to increase the capabilities of aircraft. Materials advancements have helped to increase possibilities with respect to actuation and, hence, a diversity of concepts and unimagined capabilities. The expanded role of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has provided an ideal platform for exploring these emergent morphing concepts since at this scale a greater amount of risk can be taken, as well as having more manageable fabrication and cost requirements. This review focuses on presenting the role UAVs have in morphing research by giving an overview of the UAV morphing concepts, designs, and technologies described in the literature. A presentation of quantitative information as well as a discussion of technical issues is given where possible to begin gaining some insight into the overall assessment and performance of these technologies.",

            "abstract": "This paper describes planar motion modeling for an unmanned surface vehicle (USV), including a comparative evaluation of several experimentally identified models over a wide range of speeds and planing conditions. The modeling and identification objective is to determine a model that is sufficiently rich to enable effective model-based control design and trajectory optimization, sufficiently simple to allow parameter identification, and sufficiently general to describe a variety of hullforms and actuator configurations. We focus, however, on a specific platform: a modified rigid hull inflatable boat with automated throttle and steering. Analysis of experimental results for this vessel indicates that Nomoto's first-order steering model provides the best compromise between simplicity and fidelity at higher speeds. At low speeds, it is helpful to include a first-order lag model for sideslip. Accordingly, we adopt a multiple model approach in which the model structure and parameter values are scheduled based on the nominal forward speed. The speed-scheduled planar motion model may be used to generate dynamically feasible trajectories and to develop trajectory tracking control laws. The paper describes the development, analysis, and experimental implementation of two trajectory tracking control algorithms: a cascade of proportional-derivative controllers and a nonlinear controller obtained through backstepping. Experimental results indicate that the backstepping controller is much more effective at tracking trajectories with highly variable speed and course angle. \u00a9 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Once removed from the energy management loop, the human operator is free to concentrate on higher level task management and data analysis. This paper firstly describes the design, test and construction of an autonomous Ground Recharge Stations (GRS) for battery-powered quadrotor helicopter. In order to incorporate the charging of the quadrotors in the overall swarm behaviour, the focus of the research presented here has been to reduce the charging phase of a single vehicle by developing safer electrical contacts and using a balancer in the charging process. The amount of extra current available from the new design easily pushed the flying-time/charging-time ratio of the quadrotors over 1. Then the paper describes a novel approach for the integration of this technology into an energy efficient multi-agent system. The development of a prioritisation function and queuing protocols between the UAVs and GRSs guarantee an optimised solution to the assignment problem dependent on the mission profile. Results show that the system's energy management remains efficient regardless of number and position of the platforms, or nature of the environment.",
