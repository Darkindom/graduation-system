            "abstract": "Georg Simmel [American Journal of Sociology 55:254---261 (1949)] is widely credited as the first scholar to have seriously examined sociability --- \"the sheer pleasure of the company of others\" and the central ingredient in many social forms of recreation and play. Later Ray Oldenburg [The Great Good Place. New York: Marlowe & Company (1989)] extended Simmel's work by focusing on a certain class of public settings, or \"third places,\" in which sociability tends to occur, such as, bars, coffee shops, general stores, etc. But while Simmel and Oldenburg describe activities and public spaces in the physical world, their concepts may apply as well to virtual or online worlds. Today Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) are extensive, persistent online 3D environments that are populated by hundreds of thousands of players at any given moment. The sociable nature of these online spaces is often used to explain their success: unlike previous video games, MMOGs require players to exchange information and collaborate in real-time to progress in the game. In order to shed light on this issue, we critically examine player-to-player interactions in a popular MMOG (Star Wars Galaxies). Based on several months of ethnographic observations and computerized data collection, we use Oldenburg's notion of \"third places\" to evaluate whether or not the social spaces of this virtual world fit existing definitions of sociable environments. We discuss the role online games can play in the formation and maintenance of social capital, what they can teach us about the evolution of sociability in an increasingly digitally connected social world, and what could be done to make such games better social spaces.",

            "abstract": "We designed a series of case studies for Introductory Geology Laboratory courses using computer visualization techniques integrated with traditional laboratory materials. These consist of a comprehensive case study which requires three two-hour long laboratory periods to complete, and sev- eral shorter case studies requiring one or two, two-hour laboratory periods. Currently we have proto- types of the Yellowstone National Park, Hawaii volcanoes and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge case studies. The Yellowstone prototype can be used to learn about a wide variety of rocks and minerals, about geothermal activity and hydrology, about volcanic hazards and the hot-spot theory of plate tectonics. The Hawaiian exercise goes into more depth about volcanoes, volcanic rocks and their relationship to plate movements. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge project focuses on formation of new ocean crust and min- eral-rich hydrothermal deposits at spreading centers. With new improvements in visualization technol- ogy that are making their way to personal computers, we are now closer to the ideal of a ''virtual'' field trip. We are currently making scenes of field areas in Hawaii and Yellowstone which allow the stu- dent to pan around the area and zoom in on interesting objects. Specific rocks in the scene will be able to be ''picked up'' and studied in three dimensions. This technology improves the ability of the compu- ter to present a realistic simulation of the field area and allows the student to have more control over the presentation. This advanced interactive technology is intuitive to control, relatively cheap and easy to add to existing computer programs and documents. # 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved",

About 12,000 people call this place their permanent home, although some 60,000 are present there at any given time. The nominal hourly wage is about USD 3.42 per hour, and the labors of the people produce a GNP per capita somewhere between that of Russia and Bulgaria. A unit of Norrath's currency is traded on exchange markets at USD 0.0107, higher than the Yen and the Lira. The economy is characterized by extreme inequality, yet life there is quite attractive to many. The population is growing rapidly, swollen each each day by hundreds of imigris from various places around the globe, but especially the United States. Perhaps the most interesting thing about the new world is its location. Norrath is a virtual world that exists entirely on 40 computers in San Diego. Unlike many internet ventures, virtual worlds are making money -- with annual revenues expected to top USD 1.5 billion by 2004 -- and if network effects are as powerful here as they have been with other internet innovations, virtual worlds may soon become the primary venue for all online activity.",

A definition of virtual displacement is presented that allows one to express them explicitly for holonomic (velocity independent), non-holonomic (velocity dependent), scleronomous (time independent) and rheonomous (time dependent) constraints. It is observed that for holonomic, scleronomous constraints, the virtual displacements are the displacements allowed by the constraints. However, this is not so for a general class of constraints. For simple physical systems, it is shown that the work done by the constraint forces on virtual displacements is zero. This motivates Lagrange's extension of d'Alembert's principle to a system of particles in constrained motion. However, a similar zero work principle does not hold for the allowed displacements. It is also demonstrated that d'Alembert's principle of zero virtual work is necessary for the solvability of a constrained mechanical problem. We identify this special class of constraints, physically realized and solvable, as the ideal constraints. The concept of virtual displacement and the principle of zero virtual work by constraint forces are central to both Lagrange's method of undetermined multipliers and Lagrange's equations in generalized coordinates.",

A long-running question in the design of VMs is whether stack architecture or register architecture can be implemented more efficiently with an interpreter. We extend existing work on comparing virtual stack and virtual register architectures in two ways. Firstly, our translation from stack to register code is much more sophisticated. The result is that we eliminate an average of more than 47% of executed VM instructions, with the register machine bytecode size only 25% larger than that of the corresponding stack bytecode. Secondly we present an implementation of a register machine in a fully standard-compliant implementation of the Java VM. We find that, on the Pentium 4, the register architecture requires an average of 32.3% less time to execute standard benchmarks if dispatch is performed using a C switch statement. Even if more efficient threaded dispatch is available (which requires labels as first class values), the reduction in running time is still approximately 26.5% for the register architecture.",

Traditionally, VMM schedulers have focused on fairly sharing the processor resources among domains while leaving the scheduling of I/O resources as asecondary concern. However, this can resultin poor and/or unpredictable application performance, making virtualization less desirable for applications that require efficient and consistent I/O behavior.   This paper is the first to study the impact of the VMM scheduler on performance using multiple guest domains concurrently running different types of applications. In particular, different combinations of processor-intensive, bandwidth-intensive, andlatency-sensitive applications are run concurrently to quantify the impacts of different scheduler configurations on processor and I/O performance. These applications are evaluated on 11 different scheduler configurations within the Xen VMM. These configurations include a variety of scheduler extensions aimed at improving I/O performance. This cross product of scheduler configurations and application types offers insight into the key problems in VMM scheduling for I/O and motivates future innovation in this area.",

Some, like the oxymoronic \"artificial reality\" and \"virtual reality\", suggest much higher performance than current technology can generally provide. Others, like \"cyberspace\" are puzzling neologisms. Expressions like \"virtual worlds\" and \"virtual environment\" seem preferable because they are linguistically conservative, relating to well-established terms like virtual image. In fact, we can define virtual environments as interactive, virtual image displays enhanced by special processing and by nonvisual display modalities, such as auditory and haptic, to convince users that they are immersed in a synthetic space.

Today, these diverse requirements are too often specified, communicated and managed with non-portable, site specific, loosely coupled, and out-of-band processes. We propose Virtual Machine Contracts (VMCs), a platform independent way of automating the communication and management of such requirements. We describe how VMCs can be expressed through additions to the Open Virtual Machine Format (OVF) standard and how they can be managed in a uniform way even across environments with heterogeneous elements for enforcement.

Meanwhile, interactive web-based conjoint analysis interfaces are moving this proven set of methods to the web while exploiting new capabilities to present products, features, product use, and marketing elements in streaming multimedia representations. User design exploits the interactivity of the web to enable users to design their own virtual products thus enabling the PD team to understand complex feature interactions and enabling customers to learn their own preferences for new products. These methods can be valuable for identifying opportunities, improving the design and engineering of products, and testing ideas and concepts much earlier in the process when less time and money is at risk. As products move toward pretesting and testing, virtual concept testing on the web enables PD teams to test concepts without actually building the product. Further, by combining virtual concepts and the ability of customers to interact with one another in a stock-market-like game, securities trading of concepts provides a novel way to identify winning concepts.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Prototypes of all six methods are available and have been tested with real products and real customers. These tests demonstrate reliability for web-based conjoint analysis, polyhedral methods, virtual concept testing, and stock-market-like trading; external validity for web-based conjoint analysis and polyhedral methods; and consistency for web-based conjoint analysis versus user design. We report on these tests, commercial applications, and other evaluations. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.",

            "abstract": "Summary#R##N#Technology for acquisition of virtual slides was developed in 1985; however, it was not until the late 1990s that desktop computers had enough processing speed to commercialize virtual microscopy and apply the technology to education. By 2000, the progressive decrease in use of traditional microscopy in medical student education had set the stage for the entry of virtual microscopy into medical schools. Since that time, it has been successfully implemented into many pathology courses in the United States and around the world, with surveys indicating that about 50% of pathology courses already have or expect to implement virtual microscopy. Over the last decade, in addition to an increasing ability to emulate traditional microscopy, virtual microscopy has allowed educators to take advantage of the accessibility, efficiency, and pedagogic versatility of the computer and the Internet. The cost of virtual microscopy in education is now quite reasonable after taking into account replacement cost for microscopes, maintenance of glass slides, and the fact that 1-dimensional microscope space can be converted to multiuse computer laboratories or research. Although the current technology for implementation of virtual microscopy in histopathology education is very good, it could be further improved upon by better low-power screen resolution and depth of field. Nevertheless, virtual microscopy is beginning to play an increasing role in continuing education, house staff education, and evaluation of competency in histopathology. As Z-axis viewing (focusing) becomes more efficient, virtual microscopy will also become integrated into education in cytology, hematology, microbiology, and urinalysis.",

This model enables a new device namespace mechanism and novel device proxies that integrate with lightweight operating system virtualization to multiplex phone hardware across multiple virtual phones while providing native hardware device performance.  Cells  virtual phone features include fully accelerated 3D graphics, complete power, management features, and full telephony functionality with separately assignable telephone numbers and caller ID support. We have implemented a prototype of Cells that supports multiple Android virtual phones on the same phone.

We firmly believe that the enormous expansion of the information age by leaps and bounds along with the availability of the required tools and technologies, will bring about a fourth wave of change in the near future. There have been three waves of change in the history of human progress, namely, the Agricultural Age, the Industrial Age, and the Information Age. The fourth wave of change or the Virtual Age will create a new era in which most aspects of every day life and world affairs will become virtual. Virtual Age is an umbrella which empowers anywhere, anytime, anyone interactions defying the existing time and space limitations we encounter today. The possibilities are endless, for instance; virtual commerce, virtual banking, virtual learning, virtual government, virtual work office, virtual corporations, and so on. Much higher speed CPU\u2019s, high speed transmission media (larger bandwidths), huge capacities of memory and sophisticated real-time virtual reality software are needed to power us into the Virtual Age. At the present rate of progress, it is projected that hardware and software limitations will be overcome within about two decades allowing the coming of the Virtual Age.",

These consist of a comprehensive case study which requires three two-hour long laboratory periods to complete, and sev- eral shorter case studies requiring one or two, two-hour laboratory periods. Currently we have proto- types of the Yellowstone National Park, Hawaii volcanoes and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge case studies. The Yellowstone prototype can be used to learn about a wide variety of rocks and minerals, about geothermal activity and hydrology, about volcanic hazards and the hot-spot theory of plate tectonics. The Hawaiian exercise goes into more depth about volcanoes, volcanic rocks and their relationship to plate movements. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge project focuses on formation of new ocean crust and min- eral-rich hydrothermal deposits at spreading centers. With new improvements in visualization technol- ogy that are making their way to personal computers, we are now closer to the ideal of a ''virtual'' field trip. We are currently making scenes of field areas in Hawaii and Yellowstone which allow the stu- dent to pan around the area and zoom in on interesting objects. Specific rocks in the scene will be able to be ''picked up'' and studied in three dimensions. This technology improves the ability of the compu- ter to present a realistic simulation of the field area and allows the student to have more control over the presentation.

An example experiment is described using these interfaces. This technique for creating alternative displays of wide-angle video facilitates the exploration of how compressed or fish-eye distortions affect spatial perception of the environment and can benefit the creation of interfaces for surveillance and remote system teleoperation.",

            "abstract": "Virtualization is an important enabling technology for many large private datacenters and cloud computing environments. Virtual machines often have complex expectations of their runtime environment such as access to a particular network segment or storage system. Similarly, the runtime environment may have complex expectations of a virtual machine's behavior such as compliance with network access control criteria or limits on the type and quantity of network traffic generated by the virtual machine. Today, these diverse requirements are too often specified, communicated and managed with non-portable, site specific, loosely coupled, and out-of-band processes. We propose Virtual Machine Contracts (VMCs), a platform independent way of automating the communication and management of such requirements. We describe how VMCs can be expressed through additions to the Open Virtual Machine Format (OVF) standard and how they can be managed in a uniform way even across environments with heterogeneous elements for enforcement. We explore use cases for this approach and argue that it is an essential step towards automated control and management of virtual machines in large datacenters and cloud computing environments.",

The resulting zone of quiet is generally limited in size and this requires the physical error sensor be placed at the desired location of attenuation, which is often inconvenient. To overcome this, a number of virtual sensing algorithms have been developed for active noise control. Using the physical error signal, the control signal and knowledge of the system, these virtual sensing algorithms estimate the error signal at a location that is remote from the physical error sensor, referred to as the virtual location. Instead of minimising the physical error signal, the estimated error sig- nal is minimised with the active noise control system to generate a zone of quiet at the virtual location. This paper will review a number of virtual sensing algorithms developed for active noise control.

We have implemented 4D CAD modeling into our undergraduate Architectural Engineering program. We are also experimenting with the use of immersive virtual reality and have developed a tool that allows construction engineering students to interactively generate a construction sequence for a project in an immersive environment. The results of these educational initiatives were assessed through two experiments. The first experiment assessed the educational value of having students develop 4D CAD models for a building project. The second experiment was a preliminary study to determine the educational value of immersing students in a virtual construction project and allowing them to develop a construction plan for the facility. The results of these experiments suggest that students can understand construction projects and plans much better when advanced visualization tools are used. The conclusions from the immersive virtual reality experiment suggest that students can very quickly gain experience by developing and critiquing construction schedules in a full-scale virtual environment. The students were also very engaged by this type of interactive learning experience. We envision important applications of this type of learning environment to improve construction education through the use of different case study projects. By using virtual reality, we can supplement actual construction site visits with virtual, interactive site experiences. These experiences will allow students to experiment with different construction sequences, temporary facility locations, trade coordination, safety issue identification, and design improvements for constructability.",

One class of VMMs (called Type II VMMs) builds on the abstractions provided by a host operating system. Type II VMMs are elegant and convenient, but their performance is currently an order of magnitude slower than that achieved when running outside a virtual machine (a standalone system). In this paper, we examine the reasons for this large overhead for Type II VMMs. We find that a few simple extensions to a host operating system can make it a much faster platform for running a VMM. Taking advantage of these extensions reduces virtualization overhead for a Type II VMM to 14-35% overhead, even for workloads that exercise the virtual machine intensively.",

There is an important diversity of settings and protocols involving virtual reality settings for the treatment of this pathology. Evaluation of the symptoms is often not standardized. However, our results unveil a clear effect of virtual reality settings-based rehabilitation of the patients\u2019 symptoms, assessed by objectives tools such as the DHI (mean decrease of 27 points), changing symptoms handicap perception from moderate to mild impact on life. Furthermore, we detected a relationship between the duration of the exposure to virtual reality environments and the magnitude of the therapeutic effects, suggesting that virtual reality treatments should last at least 150 minutes of cumulated exposure to ensure positive outcomes. Virtual reality offers a pleasant and safe environment for the patient. Future studies should standardize evaluation tools, document putative side effects further, compare virtual reality to conventional physical therapy, and evaluate economical costs/benefits of such strategies.",

This smart truss bridge is instrumented with fiber optic strain sensors situated on the trusses. The user interface incorporates a synchronized image of the loaded bridge and a graph of the associated strains. A static display mode allows the choice of load placement and of data for single or multiple sensors. A continuous display mode shows the dynamic images of the bridge and strains on truss members. Options include the display of experimental data or of theoretical calculations. Hyperlinks give access to information on the sensors, the bridge construction, and the theoretical analysis. The program interface can also be used in the actual experiment to display data. The intended application is a laboratory for an interdisciplinary class on smart materials and sensors.

An OS compromise gives the attacker complete access to all of an application's data, regardless of how well the application is built. We propose a new system, Virtual Ghost, that protects applications from a compromised or even hostile OS. Virtual Ghost is the first system to do so by combining compiler instrumentation and run-time checks on operating system code, which it uses to create ghost memory that the operating system cannot read or write. Virtual Ghost interposes a thin hardware abstraction layer between the kernel and the hardware that provides a set of operations that the kernel must use to manipulate hardware, and provides a few trusted services for secure applications such as ghost memory management, encryption and signing services, and key management. Unlike previous solutions, Virtual Ghost does not use a higher privilege level than the kernel.   Virtual Ghost performs well compared to previous approaches; it outperforms InkTag on five out of seven of the LMBench microbenchmarks with improvements between 1.3x and 14.3x. For network downloads, Virtual Ghost experiences a 45% reduction in bandwidth at most for small files and nearly no reduction in bandwidth for large files and web traffic. An application we modified to use ghost memory shows a maximum additional overhead of 5% due to the Virtual Ghost protections. We also demonstrate Virtual Ghost's efficacy by showing how it defeats sophisticated rootkit attacks.",

Lack of instantaneous stateful cloning forces users of cloud computing into ad hoc practices to manage application state and cycle provisioning. We present SnowFlock, our implementation of the VM fork abstraction. To evaluate SnowFlock, we focus on the demanding scenario of services requiring on-the-fly creation of hundreds of parallel workers in order to solve computationally-intensive queries in seconds.

            "abstract": "Virtual Machine (VM) fork is a new cloud computing abstraction that instantaneously clones a VM into multiple replicas running on different hosts. All replicas share the same initial state, matching the intuitive semantics of stateful worker creation. VM fork thus enables the straightforward creation and efficient deployment of many tasks demanding swift instantiation of stateful workers in a cloud environment, e.g. excess load handling, opportunistic job placement, or parallel computing. Lack of instantaneous stateful cloning forces users of cloud computing into ad hoc practices to manage application state and cycle provisioning. We present SnowFlock, our implementation of the VM fork abstraction. To evaluate SnowFlock, we focus on the demanding scenario of services requiring on-the-fly creation of hundreds of parallel workers in order to solve computationally-intensive queries in seconds. These services are prominent in fields such as bioinformatics, finance, and rendering. SnowFlock provides sub-second VM cloning, scales to hundreds of workers, consumes few cloud I/O resources, and has negligible runtime overhead.",

According to recent research by Nie and Erbring (2000) the number of Americans online has risen to 55%. Worldwide, the number of people using the Internet has risen above 450 million, and that number is expected to double within the next year. Interpersonal communication has become the primary use of the Internet at home (Kraut, Mukopadhyay, Szczypula, Kiesler, & Scherlis, 1998), and people are increasingly turning to the Internet to fulfill important social and psychological needs. One of the most basic interpersonal needs is to \u201cbelong,\u201d to feel that one is a member of a group of others who share similar interests and goals, and to feel that one is a valued (and unique) member of that group (Baumeister & Leary, 1995; Brewer, 1991).

Our attack works by sending to the JVM a Java program that is designed so that almost any memory error in its address space will allow it to take control of the JVM. All conventional Java and .NET virtual machines are vulnerable to this attack. The technique of the attack is broadly applicable against other language-based security schemes such as proof-carrying code. We measured the attack on two commercial Java virtual machines: Sun's and IBM's. We show that a single-bit error in the Java program's data space can be exploited to execute arbitrary code with a probability of about 70%, and multiple-bit errors with a lower probability. Our attack is particularly relevant against smart cards or tamper-resistant computers, where the user has physical access (to the outside of the computer) and can use various means to induce faults; we have successfully used heat.

To maximize their control, both attackers and defenders have migrated to low-level, operating system code. In this paper, we assume the perspective of the attacker, who is trying to run malicious software and avoid detection. By assuming this perspective, we hope to help defenders understand and defend against the threat posed by a new class of rootkits. We evaluate a new type of malicious software that gains qualitatively more control over a system. This new type of malware, which we call a virtual-machine based rootkit (VMBR), installs a virtual-machine monitor underneath an existing operating system and hoists the original operating system into a virtual machine. Virtual-machine based rootkits are hard to detect and remove because their state cannot be accessed by software running in the target system. Further, VMBRs support general-purpose malicious services by allowing such services to run in a separate operating system that is protected from the target system. We evaluate this new threat by implementing two proof-of-concept VMBRs. We use our proof-of-concept VMBRs to subvert Windows XP and Linux target systems, and we implement four example malicious services using the VMBR platform. Last, we use what we learn from our proof-of-concept VMBRs to explore ways to defend against this new threat. We discuss possible ways to detect and prevent VMBRs, and we implement a defense strategy suitable for protecting systems against this threat.",

Virtual network management needs to meet specific requirements, including tenant isolation and adaption to virtual machines' lifecycle. Most of the existing schemes for virtual network management are based on the use of overlay networks in order to achieve a desirable degree of flexibility. However, these schemes suffer from a common limit, i.e. relatively high performance penalty due to a complicated forwarding process. We address this performance concern by developing a new management scheme, FENet, which makes use of Software-Defined Networks (SDN) to create virtual networks and manage them via the SDN controller programs. We present the design of an SDN controller, with the definition of flow entry rules based on the OpenFlow protocol and the specification of a routing algorithm. The results from our experimental evaluation show that our SDN-based prototype can control virtual network interconnections and tenant isolation appropriately. FENet achieves about 30% better network performance than the management scheme based on OpenVPN and lower latency in comparison with the traditional bridging scheme.",

While a VM-based environment can greatly help productivity on large-scale application system. In this paper, we provide an analytic framework for the performance analyzing either without running a system or in a run able real system. With these market trends toward virtual environments, many research groups are developing evaluation tools to check the performance of virtual systems and their overheads. However, the performance characterization in virtual environments has not been established yet for many challenging issues. However, achieving close to peak performance requires careful attention to a plethora of system details.

Orthopedic impairments acquired by individuals in remote areas can then lead to permanent disabilities/loss of function because of lack of appropriate rehabilitation. A system being developed by Rutgers and Stanford Universities provides therapy at the patient's home, with remote monitoring and periodic re-assessment. This telerehabilitation system uses virtual reality and haptic interfaces, and a pair of networked PCs. It is intended for rehabilitation of patients with hand, elbow, knee and ankle impairements. Data from the first patient treated with the telerehabilitation system is encouraging.",

However, server platforms are still being designed and evaluated based on performance modeling of a single highly parallel application or a set of homogenous work-loads running simultaneously. Since most future datacenters are expected to employ server virtualization, this paper takes a look at the challenges of modeling virtual machine (VM) performance on a datacenter server. Based on vConsolidate (a server virtualization benchmark) and latest multi-core servers, we show that the VM modeling challenge requires addressing three key problems: (a) modeling the contention of visible resources (cores, memory capacity, I/O devices, etc), (b) modeling the contention of invisible resources (shared microarchitecture resources, shared cache, shared memory bandwidth, etc) and (c) modeling overheads of virtual machine monitor (or hypervisor) implementation. We take a first step to addressing this problem by describing a VM performance modeling approach and performing a detailed case study based on the vConsolidate benchmark. We conclude by outlining outstanding problems for future work.",

However, providing efficient routing with minimal overheads for mobility is still a challenge. In this paper we provide a solution to these problems by introducing Virtual Id Routing (VIR). VIR meets these basic requirements of future id-based routing schemes: namely, i) scalability - by using distributed hash table based routing framework; ii) mobility support - by separating the node-identifier from the network location; and iii) routing efficiency - by exploiting network topology information, which is done by introducing a dynamic, self-organizing virtual id (vid) space layer in between the node id space (uid) and the network topology. Preliminary evaluation of the protocol shows promising results, specifically routing stretch for VIR is very close to 1, and the overheads due to mobility are also much smaller than existing schemes such as VRR.",

With virtual machines, researchers found they could make these unwieldy architectures look sufficiently similar to existing platforms to leverage the current operating systems.

            "abstract": "Communication and information technologies are adding new capabilities for rapid and inexpensive customer input to all stages of the product development (PD) process. In this article we review six web-based methods of customer input as examples of the improved Internet capabilities of communication, conceptualization, and computation. For each method we give examples of user-interfaces, initial applications, and validity tests. We critique the applicability of the methods for use in the various stages of PD and discuss how they complement existing methods.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#For example, during the fuzzy front end of PD the information pump enables customers to interact with each other in a web-based game that provides incentives for truth-telling and thinking hard, thus providing new ways for customers to verbalize the product features that are important to them. Fast polyhedral adaptive conjoint estimation enables PD teams to screen larger numbers of product features inexpensively to identify and measure the importance of the most promising features for further development. Meanwhile, interactive web-based conjoint analysis interfaces are moving this proven set of methods to the web while exploiting new capabilities to present products, features, product use, and marketing elements in streaming multimedia representations. User design exploits the interactivity of the web to enable users to design their own virtual products thus enabling the PD team to understand complex feature interactions and enabling customers to learn their own preferences for new products. These methods can be valuable for identifying opportunities, improving the design and engineering of products, and testing ideas and concepts much earlier in the process when less time and money is at risk. As products move toward pretesting and testing, virtual concept testing on the web enables PD teams to test concepts without actually building the product. Further, by combining virtual concepts and the ability of customers to interact with one another in a stock-market-like game, securities trading of concepts provides a novel way to identify winning concepts.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Prototypes of all six methods are available and have been tested with real products and real customers. These tests demonstrate reliability for web-based conjoint analysis, polyhedral methods, virtual concept testing, and stock-market-like trading; external validity for web-based conjoint analysis and polyhedral methods; and consistency for web-based conjoint analysis versus user design. We report on these tests, commercial applications, and other evaluations. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.",

            "abstract": "The first longitudinal, controlled experiment of a video game explored the presence of cultivation effects due to play. Over the course of 1 month, participants in an online game changed their perceptions of real-world dangers. However, these dangers only corresponded to events and situations found in the game world, not other real-world crimes. This targeted finding is at odds with the broader spreading activation postulated by some cultivation researchers. The results, their implications for theory, and the study of games are discussed. doi:10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00004.x As more and more people gravitate from traditional media to customizable digital ones, it is important that we understand their new uses and effects. Video games are one of the most popular yet least studied of these new media. Previously considered as a youth-oriented activity, games are now played by a majority of Americans (Ipsos-Insight, 2005), with 32% of players older than 35 (Engle, 2001). Financially, games have passed the motion picture box office in sales (Williams, 2002). In particular, online \u2018\u2018networked\u2019\u2019 video games on both console and PC systems represent an increasingly popular space within the medium and one that has received little study. In the United States, more than 1 million people now regularly play the most popular online PC game, World of Warcraft. In this and other virtual worlds, players from around the globe interact in a shared fantasy that can involve competition, collaboration, and socializing. This takes place inside increasingly realistic-looking fantasy spaces. This paper is concerned with the possibility of cultivation effects (Gerbner, Gross, Morgan, & Signorielli, 1980) within these spaces. Cultivation theory has become a popular and contested segment of media research (Gunter, 1994; Morgan & Shanahan, 1997; Potter, 1994). Under a barrage of criticism, researchers have pushed forward to establish the presence of cultivation effects even as others have suggested serious flaws in their work (Hirsch, 1980; Newcomb, 1978; Potter). Recognizing this, this paper is concerned with two things. First, it briefly considers the major criticisms in order to devise a methodology that will account for plausible alternative explanations. Second, it tests the theory with",

Although meta-analysis revealed large declines in anxiety symptoms following VRET, moderator analyses were limited due to inconsistent reporting in the VRET literature. This highlights the need for future research studies that report uniform and detailed information regarding presence, immersion, anxiety and/or phobia duration, and demographics.",

New product development activities manifest novelty, uncertainty and complexity, presenting an extreme need for learning in the course of the work. We present data from an exploratory study of learning processes in globally dispersed new product development teams. These qualitative data are used to investigate components of team learning previously highlighted in the team learning literature\u2014namely reflection-oriented and action-oriented behaviors\u2014and to examine the boundaries of these learning behaviors. We find that effective virtual teams, like co-located teams, engage in both reflective and action-oriented learning behaviors. However, the virtual context highlights distinct participation strategies in teams\u2019 learning patterns, which aim to leverage deep, specialist knowledge, on one hand, or seek to integrate diverse knowledge, on the other hand. Moreover, our findings suggest that, in the virtual setting, the boundary of team membership is not centrally associated with different learning behaviors and outcomes, as argued in other team learning research. Instead, virtual team learning behaviors are likely to be shaped by boundaries that delimit timely access to relevant knowledge and skill. In conclusion, we discuss implications for future virtual team learning research.",

However, a thorough understanding of the reason why VR is effective and what effect it has on the human psyche is still missing. Most research on this subject is related to the concept of presence.

It starts with the most prevailing definitions and theories on presence, most of which attribute special roles for the mental process of attention and for mental models of the virtual space. A review of the phenomena thought to be effected by presence shows that there is still a strong need for research on this subject because little conclusive evidence exists regarding the relationship between presence and phenoma such as emotional responses to virtual stimuli.

Both studies were intended to shed light on the role of message boards in spreading information about self-injurious practices and influencing help-seeking behavior. More than 400 self-injury message boards were identified. Most are populated by females who describe themselves as between 12 and 20 years of age.

The population of these virtual worlds has grown rapidly since their inception in 1996; significantly, each world also seems to grow its own economy, with production, assets, and trade with Earth economies. This paper explores two questions about these developments. First, will these economies grow in importance? Second, if they do grow, how will that affect real-world economies and governments? To shed light on the first question, the paper presents a brief history of these games along with a simple choice model of the demand for game time. The history suggests that the desire to live in a game world is deep-rooted and driven by game technology. The model reveals a certain puzzle about puzzles and games: in the demand for these kinds of interactive entertainment goods, people reveal that they are willing to pay money to be constrained. Still, the nature of games as a produced good suggests that technological advances, and heavy competition, will drive the future development of virtual worlds. If virtual worlds do become a large part of the daily life of humans, their development may have an impact on the macroeconomies of Earth. It will also raise certain constitutional issues, since it is not clear, today, exactly who has jurisdiction over these new economies.",

Based on previous research, presence was hypothesized to affect the relationship between the environmental manipulations and the behavioral outcome of imitating the avatar's eating behavior. Here we show that presence did indeed affect imitation, but that the effects varied for men and women in accordance with previous research on sex differences in eating behavior.

However, a possible new application of VR in psychology is as assessment tool: VEs can be considered as an highly sophisticated form of adaptive testing. This chapter describes the context of current psychological assessment and underlines possible advantages of a VR based assessment tool. The chapter also details the characteristics of BIVRS, Body Image Virtual Reality Scale, an assessment tool designed to assess cognitive and affective components of body image. It consists of a non-immersive 3D graphical interface through which the patient is able to choose between 9 figures of different size which vary in size from underweight to overweight. The software was developed in two architectures, the first (A) running on a single user desktop computer equipped with a standard virtual reality development software and the second (B) splitted into a server (B1) accessible via Internet and actually running the same virtual ambient as in (A) and a VRML client (B2) so that anyone can access the application.",

However, providing efficient routing with minimal overheads for mobility is still a challenge. In this paper we provide a solution to these problems by introducing Virtual Id Routing (VIR). VIR meets these basic requirements of future id-based routing schemes: namely, i) scalability - by using distributed hash table based routing framework; ii) mobility support - by separating the node-identifier from the network location; and iii) routing efficiency - by exploiting network topology information, which is done by introducing a dynamic, self-organizing virtual id (vid) space layer in between the node id space (uid) and the network topology. Preliminary evaluation of the protocol shows promising results, specifically routing stretch for VIR is very close to 1, and the overheads due to mobility are also much smaller than existing schemes such as VRR.",

Immersive virtual environment technology (IVET) was used to create photorealistic virtual representations of the self that were depicted eating food in a virtual world. Changes in the virtual environment (via a changing or unchanging body) were incorporated to create variance in perceived subjective presence. Based on previous research, presence was hypothesized to affect the relationship between the environmental manipulations and the behavioral outcome of imitating the avatar's eating behavior. Here we show that presence did indeed affect imitation, but that the effects varied for men and women in accordance with previous research on sex differences in eating behavior. Men who experienced high presence were more likely than low presence men to imitate the virtual model and eat candy, whereas women who experienced high presence were more likely than low presence women to suppress the behavior and not eat candy.",

Interactive digital games and new forms of natural movementbased interface devices are also discussed in the context of the emerging area of exergaming, along with some of the early results from studies of energy expenditure during the use of these systems. While these results suggest that playing currently available active exergames uses significantly more energy than sedentary activities and is equivalent to a brisk walk, these activities do not reach the level of intensity that would match playing the actual sport, nor do they deliver the recommended daily amount of exercise for children. However, these results provide some support for the use of digital exergames using the current state of technology as a complement to, rather than a replacement, for regular exercise. This may change in the future as new advances in novel full-body interaction systems for providing vigorous interaction with digital games are expected to drive the creation of engaging, low-cost interactive game-based applications designed to increase exercise participation in persons at risk for obesity.",

Many of them offer E-Learning-Environments. The advantages seem to be obvious: easier distribution, independence of space and time, potentialities of hypertext and multimedia etc. In the field of Geoinformation and Earth Sciences a lot of projects have been carried out to use the potentials of the World Wide Web. This paper describes the current situation of E-Learning-tools in the field of Geoinformatics and Earth Sciences with some emphasis on German examples. One of them is the project \"Virtual Landscape\" of the \"E-Learning-Academic Network\" (ELAN) in Lower Saxony, Germany. The project aims to develop an E-Learning-Environment for students in Earth Sciences, such as Geodesy, Geoinformatics, Geography, Environmental Studies, Landscape Planning as well as students in Applied Computer Science. By supporting the action-oriented teaching concept the development of a \"Virtual Landscape\" will provide an interactive tool to explore and work with geodata. Special modules will guide students through the work with the data and give problems to solve. The main characteristics of this project is therefore - as opposed to projects providing only E-Learning material in terms of courseware - the explorative learning approach. Furthermore, the multidisciplinary focus is also unique. The article gives an overview on the concepts of that E-Learning-Environment as well as to the technical structure of web-based geodata visualization and interaction.",

However, nowadays, the functions of virtual campuses need to be enhanced with external e-learning applications. This paper deals with the issue of integrating these applications in virtual campuses using a software architecture based on the merging of mashup and multitier patterns. Our solution is based on an asymmetric architecture that provides seamless interconnection of the external tools with virtual campuses.

The underlying architecture consists of a sense-control-act structure that permits reactive behaviors to be locally adaptive to the environment, and a PaT-Net (parallel transition network) parallel-finite-state machine controller that can be used to drive virtual humans through complex tasks.

A major advantage to this approach is that many aspects of a distributed application can be treated independently without compromising correctness. Moreover, user code that is designed as if the system were synchronous can often be executed concurrently.
