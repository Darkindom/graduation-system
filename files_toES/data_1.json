{"abstract": "Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are stochastic search methods that mimic the natural biological evolution and/or the social behavior of species. Such algorithms have been developed to arrive at near-optimum solutions to large-scale optimization problems, for which traditional mathematical techniques may fail. This paper compares the formulation and results of five recent evolutionary-based algorithms: genetic algorithms, memetic algorithms, particle swarm, ant-colony systems, and shuffled frog leaping. A brief description of each algorithm is presented along with a pseudocode to facilitate the implementation and use of such algorithms by researchers and practitioners. Benchmark comparisons among the algorithms are presented for both continuous and discrete optimization problems, in terms of processing time, convergence speed, and quality of the results. Based on this comparative analysis, the performance of EAs is discussed along with some guidelines for determining the best operators for each algorithm.

{"abstract": "This research applies the meta-heuristic method of ant colony optimization (ACO) to an established set of vehicle routing problems (VRP). The procedure simulates the decision-making processes of ant colonies as they forage for food and is similar to other adaptive learning and artificial intelligence techniques such as Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms. Modifications are made to the ACO algorithm used to solve the traditional traveling salesman problem in order to allow the search of the multiple routes of the VRP. Experimentation shows that the algorithm is successful in finding solutions within 1% of known optimal solutions and the use of multiple ant colonies is found to provide a comparatively competitive solution technique especially for larger problems. Additionally, the size of the candidate lists used within the algorithm is a significant factor in finding improved solutions, and the computational times for the algorithm compare favorably with other solution methods. q 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Now large property owners are becoming aware of the benefits of moving IT tools from specific applications towards more comprehensive solutions. This study addresses the state of building information models and the conditions necessary for them to become more widely used. It is a qualitative study based on information from a number of international experts and has asked a series of questions about the feasibility of BIMs, the conditions necessary for their success, and the role of standards with particular reference to the IFCs. Some key statements were distilled from the diverse answers received and indicate that BIM solutions appear too complex for many and may need to be applied in limited areas initially. Standards are generally supported but not applied rigorously and a range of these are relevant to BIM. Benefits will depend upon the building procurement methods used and there should be special roles within the project team to manage information. Case studies are starting to appear and these could be used for publicity. The IFCs are rather oversold and their complexities should be hidden within simple-to-use software.

{"abstract": "Bearing failure is one of the foremost causes of breakdowns in rotating machinery and such failure can be catastrophic, resulting in costly downtime. One of the key issues in bearing prognostics is to detect the defect at its incipient stage and alert the operator before it develops into a catastrophic failure. Signal de-noising and extraction of the weak signature are crucial to bearing prognostics since the inherent deficiency of the measuring mechanism often introduces a great amount of noise to the signal. In addition, the signature of a defective bearing is spread across a wide frequency band and hence can easily become masked by noise and low frequency effects. As a result, robust methods are needed to provide more evident information for bearing performance assessment and prognostics. This paper introduces enhanced and robust prognostic methods for rolling element bearing including a wavelet filter based method for weak signature enhancement for fault identification and Self Organizing Map (SOM) based method for performance degradation assessment. The experimental results demonstrate that the bearing defects can be detected at an early stage of development when both optimal wavelet filter and SOM method are used. q 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.", "authors": ["Hai Qiu", "Jay Lee", "Jing Lin", "Gang Yu"], "fields": "artificial", "title": "Robust performance degradation assessment methods for enhanced rolling element bearing prognostics", "types": ["Low frequency", "Predictive maintenance"], "url": "http://cn.bing.com/academic/profile?id=19b350122bc7dc942522ff7e6c1b7043&encoded=0&v=paper_preview&mkt=zh-cn"}

Such information is however critical to the successful management of construction projects: It supports fundamental activities such as progress tracking and construction dimensional quality control.

(in press) [11]. A more robust point matching method is used and registration quality is improved with the implementation of an Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based fine registration step. Once the optimal registration of the project's CAD model with a site scan is obtained, a similar ICP-based registration algorithm is proposed to calculate the as-built poses of the CAD model objects. These as-built poses are then used for automatically controlling the compliance of the project with respect to corresponding dimensional tolerances. Experimental results are presented with data obtained from the erection of an industrial building's steel structure.

{"abstract": "Although the importance of knowledge sharing among designers has been widely recognized, knowledge about functionality in the conceptual design phase is hard to capture and is often scattered across technical domains. Aimed at capturing such functional knowledge that can easily be applied to other domains, we developed an ontological framework to systematically describe it. It includes six kinds of knowledge about functionality, i.e. two types of functional models, two types of organization of generic knowledge, and two ontologies of functionality. This paper reports on the successful deployment of the framework in a production company. The Plant and Production Systems Engineering Division of Sumitomo Electric Industries has used our framework to share functional design knowledge on production systems since May, 2001. An empirical evaluation by Sumitomo's engineers was unanimously positive. They said that this framework enabled them to make implicit knowledge possessed by each designer explicit and to share it among team members. This paper discusses some successful use-cases in tasks such as a design review, a patent application, and solving a quality problem.

{"abstract": "Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a design tool that mitigates risks during the design phase before they occur. Although many industries use the current FMEA technique, it has many limitations and problems. Risk is measured in terms of Risk Priority Number (RPN) that is a product of occurrence, severity, and detection difficulty. Measuring severity and detection difficulty is very subjective and with no universal scale. RPN is also a product of ordinal variables, which is not meaningful as a proper measure. This paper addresses these shortcomings and introduces a new methodology, Life Cost-Based FMEA, which measures risk in terms of cost. Life Cost-Based FMEA is useful for comparing and selecting design alternatives that can reduce the overall life cycle cost of a particular system. Next, a Monte Carlo simulation is applied to the Cost-Based FMEA to account for the uncertainties in: detection time, fixing time, occurrence, delay time, down time, and model complex scenarios.
