That is the overall message of this year's World Development Report (WDR), the 30th in the series. Three out of every four poor people in developing countries live in rural areas, and most of them depend directly or indirectly on agriculture for their livelihoods. This report provides guidance to governments and the international community on designing and implementing agriculture for development agendas that can make a difference in the lives of hundreds of millions of rural poor. The report highlights two major regional challenges. In much of Sub-Saharan Africa, agriculture is a strong option for spurring growth, overcoming poverty, and enhancing food security. Agricultural productivity growth is vital for stimulating growth in other parts of the economy. But accelerated growth requires a sharp productivity increase in smallholder farming combined with more effective support to the millions coping as subsistence farmers, many of them in remote areas. Recent improved performance holds promise, and this report identifies many emerging successes that can be scaled up. In Asia, overcoming widespread poverty requires confronting widening rural-urban income disparities. Asia's fast-growing economies remain home to over 600 million rural people living in extreme poverty, and despite massive rural-urban migration, rural poverty will remain dominant for several more decades. For this reason, the WDR focuses on ways to generate rural jobs by diversifying into labor intensive, high value agriculture linked to a dynamic rural, non-farm sector. In all regions, with rising land and water scarcity and the added pressures of a globalizing world, the future of agriculture is intrinsically tied to better stewardship of natural resources. With the right incentives and investments, agriculture's environmental footprint can be lightened and environmental services harnessed to protect watersheds and biodiversity.", "authors": ["Robert Townsend", "Elisabeth Sadoulet", "Alain De Janvry", "Derek Byerlee", "Irina Klytchnikova"], "fields": "telecommunications", "title": "World development report 2008 : agriculture for development", "types": ["Property rights", "Credit risk", "Transport", "Value added", "Natural resource"], "url": "http://cn.bing.com/academic/profile?id=7c9661dccdcef970a4f7f29b30a571c3&encoded=0&v=paper_preview&mkt=zh-cn"}"{'index': {'_type': u'telecommunications', '_id': 3, '_index': 'info'}}<br/>"{"abstract": "This paper reviews the published articles on eTourism in the past 20 years.

The patent thicket is especially thorny when combined with the risk of hold-up, namely the danger that new products will inadvertently infringe on patents issued after these products were designed. The need to navigate the patent thicket and hold-up is especially pronounced in industries such as telecommunications and computing in which formal standard-setting is a core part of bringing new technologies to market. Cross-licenses and patent pools are two natural and effective methods used by market participants to cut through the patent thicket, but each involves some transaction costs. Antitrust law and enforcement, with its historical hostility to cooperation among horizontal rivals, can easily add to these transaction costs. Yet a few relatively simple principles, such as the desirability package licensing for complementary patents but not for substitute patents, can go a long way towards insuring that antitrust will help solve the problems caused by the patent thicket and by hold-up rather than exacerbating them.", "authors": ["Carl Shapiro"], "fields": "telecommunications", "title": "Navigating the Patent Thicket: Cross Licenses, Patent Pools, and Standard-Setting", "types": ["Biotechnology", "Telecommunications", "Transaction cost", "Semiconductor"], "url": "http://cn.bing.com/academic/profile?id=0080973e878c62cfbf55bd3f7c0b1289&encoded=0&v=paper_preview&mkt=zh-cn"}"{'index': {'_type': u'telecommunications', '_id': 6, '_index': 'info'}}<br/>"{"abstract": "This study attempts to find appropriate interaction analysis/content analysis techniques that assist in examining the negotiation of meaning and co-construction of knowledge in collaborative learning environments facilitated by computer conferencing.

First, widespread usage creates universal access, a public good that individuals cannot be prevented from enjoying even if they have not contributed to it. Second, use of interactive media entails reciprocal interdependence, in which earlier users are influenced by later users as well as vice versa. Consequently, interactive media are extremely vulnerable to start-up problems and discontinuance.

Most previous studies have focused on the prevalence of text message and email bullying. Methods: Two surveys with pupils aged 11\u201316 years: (1) 92 pupils from 14 schools, supplemented by focus groups; (2) 533 pupils from 5 schools, to assess the generalisability of findings from the first study, and investigate relationships of cyberbullying to general internet use. Both studies differentiated cyberbullying inside and outside of school, and 7 media of cyberbullying. Results: Both studies found cyberbullying less frequent than traditional bullying, but appreciable, and reported more outside of school than inside. Phone call and text message bullying were most prevalent, with instant messaging bullying in the second study; their impact was perceived as comparable to traditional bullying. Mobile phone/video clip bullying, while rarer, was perceived to have more negative impact. Age and gender differences varied between the two studies. Study 1 found that most cyberbullying was done by one or a few students, usually from the same year group. It often just lasted about a week, but sometimes much longer. The second study found that being a cybervictim, but not a cyberbully, correlated with internet use; many cybervictims were traditional \u2018bully-victims\u2019. Pupils recommended blocking/avoiding messages, and telling someone, as the best coping strategies; but many cybervictims had told nobody about it.

One of the central questions for industrial policy is how to regulate firms with market power. Regulatory Reform tackles this important policy issue in two parts: it describes an analytical framework for studying the main issues in regulatory reform, and then applies the analysis to the British experience in four utility industries--telecommunications, gas, electricity, and water supply. Britain's utility industries, state-owned monopolies just ten years ago, offer a dramatic example of comprehensive reforms with parallels elsewhere: industries have been restructured, markets have been liberalized, and new regulatory methods and institutions have been created. The authors focus on common policy questions that arise in each industry while taking into account the considerable diversity between the industries and the different reform policies adopted. The analysis and experience in Britain's utility industries also provides a rich variety of issues concerning monopolistic and anticompetitive practices that are of interest for competition policy in general.", "authors": ["Mark Armstrong", "Simon Cowan", "John Vickers"], "fields": "telecommunications", "title": "Regulatory Reform: Economic Analysis and British Experience", "types": ["Telecommunications", "Water", "Industrial policy", "Water supply", "Electricity"], "url": "http://cn.bing.com/academic/profile?id=32e0725650dd9222b31ca3151824da25&encoded=0&v=paper_preview&mkt=zh-cn"}"{'index': {'_type': u'telecommunications', '_id': 11, '_index': 'info'}}<br/>"{"abstract": "We present some information-theoretic considerations used to determine upper bounds on the information rates that can be reliably transmitted over a two-ray propagation path mobile radio channel model, operating in a time division multiplex access (TDMA) regime, under given decoding delay constraints.

In this case, no coding capacity in the strict Shannon sense exists. Simple schemes for time and space diversity are examined, and their potential benefits are illuminated from an information-theoretic stand point. In our presentation, we chose to specialize to the TDMA protocol for the sake of clarity and convenience.
