Target-tracking represents motion control scenarios where no information about the target behavior is known in advance, i.e., the path that the target traverses is not defined apriori. Specifically, this work presents the design of a motion control system which enables an underactuated USV to track a target that moves in a straight line at high speed. The motion control system employs a guidance principle originally developed for interceptor missiles, as well as a novel velocity controller inspired by maneuverability and agility concepts found in fighter aircraft literature. The performance of the suggested design is illustrated through full-scale USV experiments in the Trondheimsfjord.", "authors": ["Morten Breivik", "Vegard E Hovstein", "Thor I Fossen"], "fields": "unmanned", "title": "Straight-Line Target Tracking for Unmanned Surface Vehicles", "types": ["Motion control", "Control system"], "url": "http://cn.bing.com/academic/profile?id=69a3b1ba3e17a547101022306a65a969&encoded=0&v=paper_preview&mkt=zh-cn"}"{'index': {'_type': u'unmanned', '_id': 5, '_index': 'info'}}<br/>"{"abstract": "Abstract : To better understand trends in Chinese unmanned systems research, development, acquisition, and employment, and their potential implications, RAND undertook exploratory analysis to lay an initial foundation for future research on China's development and use of unmanned systems, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs), and unmanned surface vessels (USVs).
