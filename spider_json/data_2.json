            "abstract": "We have developed a new vector strategy for the insertion of foreign genes into the genomes of gram negative bacteria not closely related to Escherichia coli. The system consists of two components: special E. coli donor strains and derivatives of E. coli vector plasmids. The donor strains (called mobilizing strains) carry the transfer genes of the broad host range IncP\u2013type plasmid RP4 integrated in their chromosomes. They can utilize any gram negative bacterium as a recipient for conjugative DNA transfer. The vector plasmids contain the P\u2013type specific recognition site for mobilization (Mob site) and can be mobilized with high frequency from the donor strains. The mobilizable vectors are derived from the commonly used E. coli vectors pACYC184, pACYC177, and pBR325, and are unable to replicate in strains outside the enteric bacterial group. Therefore, they are widely applicable as transposon carrier replicons for random transposon insertion mutagenesis in any strain into which they can be mobilized but not stably maintained. The vectors are especially useful for site\u2013directed transposon mutagenesis and for site\u2013specific gene transfer in a wide variety of gram negative organisms.",

We hypothesized that the daffodil gene encoding phytoene synthase (psy), one of the two genes used to develop Golden Rice, was the limiting step in \u03b2-carotene accumulation. Through systematic testing of other plant psys, we identified a psy from maize that substantially increased carotenoid accumulation in a model plant system. We went on to develop 'Golden Rice 2' introducing this psy in combination with the Erwinia uredovora [Pantoea ananatis pv. uredovora] carotene desaturase (crtI) used to generate the original Golden Rice. We observed an increase in total carotenoids of up to 23-fold (maximum 37 \u00b5g/g) compared to the original Golden Rice and a preferential accumulation of \u03b2-carotene.",

The objective of this study was to determine the impact of creep feeding and adding GLN or AminoGut (AG; containing glutamine + glutamate) to pre- and post-weaning diets on pig performance and intestinal health. Litters (N = 120) were allotted to four treatments during 14\u201321 d of lactation: 1) No creep feed (NC, n = 45); 2) creep fed control diet (CFCD, n = 45); 3) creep fed 1% GLN (CFGLN, n = 15); 4) creep fed .88% AG (CFAG, n = 15). After weaning, the NC and CFCD groups were sub-divided into three groups (n = 15 each), receiving either a control nursery diet (NC-CD, CFCD-CD) or a diet supplemented with either GLN (NC-GLN, CFCD-GLN) or with AG (NC-AG, CFCD-AG). Litters that were creep fed with diets containing GLN or AG also were supplemented with those amino acids in the nursery diets (CFGLN-GLN, CFAG-AG). Glutamine was added at 1% in all three post-weaning diet phases and AG was added at .88% in phase 1 and 2 and at .66% in phase 3. Results: Feed conversion (feed/gain) showed means among treatment means close to significance (P= 0.056) and Tukey\u2019s test for pairwise mean comparisons showed that Pigs in the CFGLN-GLN group had the best feed conversion (feed/gain) in the first three-week period post-weaning, exceeding (P= 0.044) controls (CFCD-CD) by 34%. The NC-AG group had (P = 0.02) the greatest feed intake in the last three week of the study, exceeding controls (CFCD-CD) by 12%. CFGLN-GLN, CFCD-GLN and sow reared (SR) pigs had the greatest (P = 0.049) villi height exceeding the CFCD-AG group by 18%, 20% and 19% respectively. The CFAG-AG group had the deepest (P= 0.001) crypts among all treatments. CFGLN-GLN, CFCD-GLN and SR groups had the greatest (P = 0.001) number of cells proliferating (PCNA) exceeding those in the NC-CD group by 43%, 54% and 63% respectively. Sow reared pigs showed the greatest (P = 0.001) intestinal absorption capacity for xylose and mannitol. Conclusion: Supplementation of creep feed and nursery diets with GLN and/or AminoGut in the first three week improved feed conversion possibly due to improved intestinal health.",

Much in biotechnology can be celebrated for how it benefits humanity. But technology can have a darker side. Biotechnology can produce unanticipated consequences that cause harm or dehumanise people. The ethical implications of proposed developments must be carefully examined. The ethical assessment of new technologies, including biotechnology, requires a different approach to ethics. Changes are necessary because new technology can have a more profound impact on the world; because of limitations with a rights-based approach to ethics; because of the importance and difficulty of predicting consequences; and because biotechnology now manipulates humans themselves. The ethical questions raised by biotechnology are of a very different nature. Given the potential to profoundly change the future course of humanity, such questions require careful consideration. Rather than focussing on rights and freedoms, wisdom is needed to articulate our responsibilities towards nature and others, including future generations.

Developing countries address these challenges in different ways, including public and private sector investments in plant breeding and other modern tools for genetic crop improvement. In order to measure the impact of any technology and prioritize investments, we must assess the relevant resources, human capacity, clusters, networks and linkages, as well as the institutions performing technological research and development, and the rate of farmer adoption. However, such measures have not been recently assessed, in part due to the lack of complete standardized information on public plant breeding and biotechnology research in developing countries. To tackle this void, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in consultation with the International Food Policy Institute (IFPRI) and other organizations, designed a plant breeding and biotechnology capacity survey for implementation by FAO consultants in 100 developing countries. IFPRI, in collaboration with FAO and national experts contracted by FAO to complete in-country surveys, identified and analyzed plant breeding and biotechnology programs in four developing countries: Cameroon, Kenya, the Philippines, and Venezuela. Here, we use an innovation systems framework to examine the investments in human and financial resources and the distribution of resources among the different programs, as well as the capacity and policy development for agricultural research in the four selected countries. Based on our findings, we present recommendations to help sustain and increase the efficiency of publicly- and privately-funded plant breeding programs, while maximizing the use of genetic resources and developing opportunities for GM crop production. Policy makers, private sector breeders, and other stakeholders can use this information to prioritize investments, consider product advancement, and assess the relative magnitude of the potential risks and benefits of their investments.\" from Author's Abstract",

Crops have been made resistant to herbicides by inserting transgenes that impart herbicide resistance into the plant genome. Glyphosate- and glufosinate-resistant crops are commercialized in North America and crops made resistant to 2,4-D, dicamba, and hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-inhibiting herbicides will soon be grown. This technology has been highly successful in transforming weed management in several major crops. Selection for mutations that impart herbicide resistance to crops has also been successfully used to generate herbicide-resistant crops. There are several living microbial products for the biocontrol of weeds. These agents have not been very successful, but research is being conducted to improve them with biotechnology methods. The use of crops that produce their own herbicides (allelopathy) has been even less successful. Biotechnological approaches are being used to generate crops that are toxic to weeds with less or without synthetic chemical inputs. Research on natural phytotoxins from plants (allelochemicals) has also provided lead compounds for herbicide discovery.#R##N##R##N##R##N#Keywords:#R##N##R##N#allelopathy;#R##N#biocontrol;#R##N#biotechnology;#R##N#glufosinate;#R##N#glyphosate;#R##N#herbicide-resistant crop;#R##N#transgene",

            "abstract": "Nowadays plant biotechnology faces many important challenges, including the development of strategies to secure global food supply, the adequate acquisition and management of plant derived products for human subsistence (woods, pharmaceuticals, biofuels, etc.), as well as the development of plants that can cope with the constant effects of biotic and abiotic stress conditions in the era of changing climatic conditions. Being sessile, plants are able to adapt or acclimate after constant exposition to environmental stress conditions; nevertheless, in most cases growth rate and yield are reduced below optimum levels. Increases in global warming, climatic changes, soil degradation, and pollution, are affecting dramatically the plant kingdom. #R##N##R##N#Advances in plant molecular biology and biotechnology have changed our capabilities for gene discovery, the study of tissue-specific promoters, the functional characterization of genes, gene pyramiding, and the generation of efficient methods for plant genetic transformation and/or plant genome manipulation. All of these beneficial applications offer the possibility to achieve pest resistance, abiotic stress tolerance, crop yield improvement, and excel food nutritional quality. #R##N##R##N#In this regard, the understanding of plant molecular mechanisms underlying biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, the characterization of hormone mediated signaling pathways, and the molecular interaction and crosstalk among pathways will improve our knowledge in plant stress biology.#R##N##R##N#This special issue consists of six papers related to abiotic and biotic plant stress. Papers by M. Perez-Clemente et al., L.-T. Yang et al., and A. S. Dubrovina et al. present interesting reviews of diverse topics such as plant response to stress, aluminium tolerance in higher plants, and pre-mRNA splicing under plant stress conditions, respectively. The following three are research papers focusing on identification of rice genes in response to heat stress (Y. Cao et al.), transcriptional profiling of canker-resistant transgenic sweet orange (X.-Z. Fu and J.\u2013H. Liu), and characterization of the newly developed soybean cultivar (DT2008) under drought tolerance (C. V. Ha et al.). #R##N##R##N#M. Perez-Clemente et al. outline the main biotechnological approaches used to study plant stress responses, such as the \u201comics\u201d technologies (genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics), and transgenic-based approaches. As well, considerable advances in plant physiology, genetics, and molecular biology are included, which have greatly improved our understanding of plant responses to abiotic stress conditions. #R##N##R##N#A. S. Dubrovina et al. review recent data on alternative splicing in plant genes involved in stress signaling; in particular the authors focus on the occurrence, properties, and functional consequences of unconventional splicing and splicing-like events in plants. Precursor mRNAs with introns can undergo alternative splicing to produce multiple transcripts from the same gene by differential use of splice sites, thereby increasing the transcriptome and proteome complexity. In order to survive the stress conditions, plants actively employ pre-mRNA splicing as a mechanism to regulate expression of stress-responsive genes and reprogram intracellular regulatory networks. This review is attractive since it provides data on transcript diversity generated in response to environmental stresses, an aspect that could be important to plant biotechnology in terms of developing new strategies for crop breeding and protection.#R##N##R##N#L.-T. Yang et al. describe the main mechanisms related to aluminium tolerance in plants facing acidic soils, where aluminium toxicity is an important factor that limits crop productivity. Importance is given to the secretion of organic acid ions from plant roots and the possible mechanisms that regulate this process, including ion channels or transporters, internal concentration of organic acid ions, root plasma membrane H-ATPase, and temperature, among others. As well, transgenic plants attempting to increase the secretion and biosynthesis of organic acid anions as an approach for the acquisition of aluminium tolerance are discussed as potential research area.#R##N##R##N#In the research article presented by Y. Cao et al., the importance of studying heat stress responses in plant crops, such as rice, is emphasized, in particular, because of global warming and its increasing impact on crop production at the present time. In rice, several papers involving heat shock proteins (HSPs) and heat shock transcription factors in the heat stress response have been published; nevertheless, little is known about other genes induced under this condition. Based on cDNA-AFLP analysis, the authors identified 49 differentially expressed genes, including genes related to carbohydrate metabolism, photosynthesis and energy production, and amino acid and polyamine metabolism and transport, among others, as heat stress-responsive genes in rice. The possible implication of these genes in heat stress response is discussed.#R##N##R##N#In the research article presented by X.-Z. Fu and J.-H. Liu, they analyzed the global transcriptional profiling of transgenic sweet orange line (TG9) using the Affymetrix Citrus GeneChip microarray. TG9 line overexpresses Malus domestica spermidine synthase (MdSPDS1); it has increased levels of the polyamines, spermidine and spermine, and confers canker resistance. Nowadays, the gene regulation network in polyamine which involved plant pathogen response is largely unclear, particularly in perennial plants like citrus. A profile of genes up- and downregulated under high polyamine levels in the TG9 line is presented. It is hypothesized that genes implicated in stimulus response and immune system process, cell wall and transcriptional regulation, and cellular and metabolism processes, such as starch and sucrose metabolism, glutathione metabolism, biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids, and plant hormones play major roles in the canker resistance of TG9. #R##N##R##N#In the research article presented by C. V. Ha et al., drought-tolerant phenotypes of DT2008 soybean variety and W82 soybean cultivar were compared by examining the dehydration-induced water loss and membrane stability of the shoot parts of young seedlings. DT2008 is an improved variety of soybean that shows enhanced drought tolerance and stable yield in field conditions. The authors propose that further comparisons between DT2008 and W82 cultivars using molecular approaches will enable the identification of mutations associated with drought tolerance in DT2008, which could be used to improve drought tolerance in soybean cultivars through genetic engineering. #R##N##R##N#In the research article presented by C.

Molecular analysis between these soybean cultivars will enable the identification of mutations, which could be candidates for genetic engineering to improve drought tolerance in soybean cultivars.",

Humans have been manipulating genetic material for centuries. This chapter provides an overview of environmental biotechnology. An assessment is only as good as the assumptions and information from which it is drawn. Good science must underpin the environmental decisions. One must enlist the expertise of engineers, microbiologists, botanists, zoologists, geneticists, medical researchers, geologists, geographers, land use planners, hydrologists, meteorologists, computational experts, systems biologists, and ecologists to characterize the risks and opportunities of environmental biotechnology. The only way to characterize biological systems is by simultaneously addressing chemical reactions, motion, and biological processes. Mass and energy exchanges are constantly taking place within and between cells, and at every scale of an ecosystem or a human population. Thus, biochemodynamics addresses energy and matter as they move, change, and cycle through organisms. A single chemical or organism undergoes the process from its release to its environmental fate.",
