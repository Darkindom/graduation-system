This is equally true in the solid state, where spontaneous emission plays a fundamental role in limiting the performance of semiconductor lasers, heterojunction bipolar transistors. and solar cells. If a three dimensionally periodic dielectric structure has an electromagnetic band gap which overlaps the electronic band edge then spontaneous emission can be rigorously forbidden.",

Either adding the spin degree of freedom to conventional charge-based electronic devices or using the spin alone has the potential advantages of nonvolatility, increased data processing speed, decreased electric power consumption, and increased integration densities compared with conventional semiconductor devices. To successfully incorporate spins into existing semiconductor technology, one has to resolve technical issues such as efficient injection, transport, control and manipulation, and detection of spin polarization as well as spin-polarized currents. Recent advances in new materials engineering hold the promise of realizing spintronic devices in the near future. We review the current state of the spin-based devices, efforts in new materials fabrication, issues in spin transport, and optical spin manipulation.",

The method is based on the integral conservation laws and is dissipative, so that it can be used across shocks. The heart of the method is a one-dimensional Lagrangean scheme that may be regarded as a second-order sequel to Godunov\u2019s method. The second-order accuracy is achieved by taking the distributions of the state quantities inside a gas slab to be linear, rather than uniform as in Godunov\u2019s method. The Lagrangean results are remapped with least-squares accuracy onto the desired Euler grid in a separate step. Several monotonicity algorithms are applied to ensure positivity, monotonicity and nonlinear stability. Higher dimensions are covered through time splitting. Numerical results for one-dimensional and two-dimensional flows are presented, demonstrating the efficiency of the method. The paper concludes with a summary of the results of the whole series \u201cTowards the Ultimate Conservative Difference Scheme.\u201d This paper describes a method of second-order accuracy for integrating the equations of ideal compressible flow (ICF). The method is based on the integral conservation laws and is dissipative, so that it can be used across shocks. The heart of the method is a one-dimensional Lagrangean scheme, the results of which are remapped onto the desired Euler grid in a separate step. Higher dimensions are covered through time splitting. The Lagrangean scheme may be regarded as a second-order sequel to Godunov\u2019s [I] first-order Lagrangean scheme. As in the latter, the gas is divided into slabs, and the interaction of these slabs at their interfaces is considered in detail. Whereas in Godunov\u2019s method the distribution of the state quantities inside a slab are taken to be uniform, in the present method these distributions are taken to be linear. The information contained in the slopes of the distributions makes it possible to attain second-order accuracy in the method. As in Godunov\u2019s method, the interaction of slabs is evaluated essentially on the basis of the characteristic equations, with due care taken to account for the discontinuities in the interaction flow. The convective difference scheme, hidden in the Lagrangean scheme, for integrating the characteristic equations is a so-called upstream-centered (upwind) scheme and has been discussed as \u201cscheme II\u201d in the pre",

We need a governance mechanism that maintains a balance between the global public goods characteristics of genomics knowledge and the private goods nature of its application. Networks may well be an appropriate way of preventing a bleak future of increasing disparities between industrialised and developing countries. An informed debate that attempts to exchange the politics of polarisation with a truly participatory process would be worth pursuing.

Here, we report a simple method to engineer the light outcoupling in semiconducting TMDCs by modulating their dielectric surroundings. We show that by modulating the thicknesses of underlying substrates and capping layers, the interference caused by substrate can significantly enhance the light absorption and emission of WSe2, resulting in a \u223c11 times increase in Raman signal and a \u223c30 times increase in the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of WSe2. On the basis of the interference model, we also propose a strategy to control the photonic and optoelectronic properties of thin-layer WSe2. This work demonstrates the utilization of outcoupling engineering in 2D materials and offers a new route toward the realization of novel optoelectronic devices, such as 2D LEDs and solar cells.",
