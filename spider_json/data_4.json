Arlequin 3 introduces a completely new graphical interface written in C++, a more robust semantic analysis of input fi les, and two new methods: a Bayesian estimation of gametic phase from multi-locus genotypes, and an estimation of the parameters of an instantaneous spatial expansion from DNA sequence polymorphism. Arlequin can handle several data types like DNA sequences, microsatellite data, or standard multi-locus genotypes.

Our studies of graphene - a single atomic layer of carbon - have revealed a variety of unusual phenomena characteristic of two-dimensional (2D) Dirac fermions. In particular, we have observed that a) the integer quantum Hall effect in graphene is anomalous in that it occurs at half-integer filling factors; b) graphene's conductivity never falls below a minimum value corresponding to the conductance quantum e^2/h, even when carrier concentrations tend to zero; c) the cyclotron mass m of massless carriers with energy E in graphene is described by equation E =mc*^2; and d) Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in graphene exhibit a phase shift of pi due to Berry's phase.",

We now appreciate that immune microenvironments in solid tumors are targets for anticancer therapy, whereby therapeutics aim to neutralize their tumor-promoting activities, which is coincident with bolstering their embedded activities to foster T cell mobilization and cytotoxic functions through enhanced recognition of tumor-specific antigens. The key leukocytes that contribute to acute versus chronic inflammation in cancer, as well as the mechanisms by which they do so are subjects of the ongoing investigations.

Therefore, the effect of such factors on risk of coronary heart disease in most regions of the world is unknown. Methods We established a standardised case-control study of acute myocardial infarction in 52 countries, representing every inhabited continent. 15 152 cases and 14 820 controls were enrolled. The relation of smoking, history of hypertension or diabetes, waist/hip ratio, dietary patterns, physical activity, consumption of alcohol, blood apolipoproteins (Apo), and psychosocial factors to myocardial infarction are reported here. Odds ratios and their 99% CIs for the association of risk factors to myocardial infarction and their population attributable risks (PAR) were calculated. Findings Smoking (odds ratio 2\u00b787 for current vs never, PAR 35\u00b77% for current and former vs never), raised ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (3\u00b725 for top vs lowest quintile, PAR 49\u00b72% for top four quintiles vs lowest quintile), history of hypertension (1\u00b791, PAR 17\u00b79%), diabetes (2\u00b737, PAR 9\u00b79%), abdominal obesity (1\u00b712 for top vs lowest tertile and 1\u00b762 for middle vs lowest tertile, PAR 20\u00b71% for top two tertiles vs lowest tertile), psychosocial factors (2\u00b767, PAR 32\u00b75%), daily consumption of fruits and vegetables (0\u00b770, PAR 13\u00b77% for lack of daily consumption), regular alcohol consumption (0\u00b791, PAR 6\u00b77%), and regular physical activity (0\u00b786, PAR 12\u00b72%), were all significantly related to acute myocardial infarction (p<0\u00b70001 for all risk factors and p=0\u00b703 for alcohol). These associations were noted in men and women, old and young, and in all regions of the world. Collectively, these nine risk factors accounted for 90% of the PAR in men and 94% in women. Interpretation Abnormal lipids, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors, consumption of fruits, vegetables, and alcohol, and regular physical activity account for most of the risk of myocardial infarction worldwide in both sexes and at all ages in all regions. This finding suggests that approaches to prevention can be based on similar principles worldwide and have the potential to prevent most premature cases of myocardial infarction.",

Moreover, 55 of the 66 formerly HPV-negative biopsies were also reanalysed by a sandwich procedure in which the outer sections in a series of sections are used for histological review, while the inner sections are assayed by three different HPV PCR assays targeting different open reading frames (ORFs). No significant difference was found in serology for HPV 16 proteins between the cases that were originally HPV PCR-negative and -positive. Type-specific E7 PCR for 14 high-risk HPV types detected HPV DNA in 38 (69 per cent) of the 55 originally HPV-negative and amplifiable specimens. The HPV types detected were 16, 18, 31, 33, 39, 45, 52, and 58. Two (4 per cent) additional cases were only HPV DNA-positive by E1 and/or L1 consensus PCR. Histological analysis of the 55 specimens revealed that 21 were qualitatively inadequate. Only two of the 34 adequate samples were HPV-negative on all PCR tests, as against 13 of the 21 that were inadequate ( p< 0\u00b7001). Combining the data from this and the previous study and excluding inadequate specimens, the worldwide HPV prevalence in cervical carcinomas is 99\u00b77 per cent. The presence of HPV in virtually all cervical cancers implies the highest worldwide attributable fraction so far reported for a specific cause of any major human cancer. The extreme rarity of HPV-negative cancers reinforces the rationale for HPV testing in addition to, or even instead of, cervical cytology in routine cervical screening.

A preliminary study suggested that sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and Raf may be effective in hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods In this multicenter, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 602 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who had not received previous systemic treatment to receive either sorafenib (at a dose of 400 mg twice daily) or placebo. Primary outcomes were overall survival and the time to symptomatic progression. Secondary outcomes included the time to radiologic progression and safety. Results At the second planned interim analysis, 321 deaths had occurred, and the study was stopped. Median overall survival was 10.7 months in the sorafenib group and 7.9 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the sorafenib group, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.55 to 0.87; P<0.001). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the median time to symptomatic progression (4.1 months vs. 4.9 months, respectively, P=0.77). The median time to radiologic progression was 5.5 months in the sorafenib group and 2.8 months in the placebo group (P<0.001). Seven patients in the sorafenib group (2%) and two patients in the placebo group (1%) had a partial response; no patients had a complete response. Diarrhea, weight loss, hand-foot skin reaction, and hypophosphatemia were more frequent in the sorafenib group. Conclusions In patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, median survival and the time to radiologic progression were nearly 3 months longer for patients treated with sorafenib than for those given placebo.",

            "abstract": "Global and regional projections of mortality and burden of disease by cause for the years 2000 2010 and 2030 were published by Murray and Lopez in 1996 as part of the Global Burden of Disease project. These projections which are based on 1990 data continue to be widely quoted although they are substantially outdated; in particular they substantially underestimated the spread of HIV/AIDS. To address the widespread demand for information on likely future trends in global health and thereby to support international health policy and priority setting we have prepared new projections of mortality and burden of disease to 2030 starting from World Health Organization estimates of mortality and burden of disease for 2002. This paper describes the methods assumptions input data and results. Relatively simple models were used to project future health trends under three scenarios-- baseline optimistic and pessimistic--based largely on projections of economic and social development and using the historically observed relationships of these with cause-specific mortality rates. Data inputs have been updated to take account of the greater availability of death registration data and the latest available projections for HIV/AIDS income human capital tobacco smoking body mass index and other inputs. In all three scenarios there is a dramatic shift in the distribution of deaths from younger to older ages and from communicable maternal perinatal and nutritional causes to noncommunicable disease causes. The risk of death for children younger than 5 y is projected to fall by nearly 50% in the baseline scenario between 2002 and 2030. The proportion of deaths due to noncommunicable disease is projected to rise from 59% in 2002 to 69% in 2030. Global HIV/AIDS deaths are projected to rise from 2.8 million in 2002 to 6.5 million in 2030 under the baseline scenario which assumes coverage with antiretroviral drugs reaches 80% by 2012. Under the optimistic scenario which also assumes increased prevention activity HIV/AIDS deaths are projected to drop to 3.7 million in 2030. Total tobacco-attributable deaths are projected to rise from 5.4 million in 2005 to 6.4 million in 2015 and 8.3 million in 2030 under our baseline scenario. Tobacco is projected to kill 50% more people in 2015 than HIV/AIDS and to be responsible for 10% of all deaths globally. The three leading causes of burden of disease in 2030 are projected to include HIV/AIDS unipolar depressive disorders and ischaemic heart disease in the baseline and pessimistic scenarios. Road traffic accidents are the fourth leading cause in the baseline scenario and the third leading cause ahead of ischaemic heart disease in the optimistic scenario. Under the baseline scenario HIV/AIDS becomes the leading cause of burden of disease in middle- and low-income countries by 2015. These projections represent a set of three visions of the future for population health based on certain explicit assumptions. Despite the wide uncertainty ranges around future projections they enable us to appreciate better the implications for health and health policy of currently observed trends and the likely impact of fairly certain future trends such as the ageing of the population the continued spread of HIV/AIDS in many regions and the continuation of the epidemiological transition in developing countries. The results depend strongly on the assumption that future mortality trends in poor countries will have a relationship to economic and social development similar to those that have occurred in the higher-income countries.

There is indirect evidence that agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \ufffd (PPAR \ufffd ) could reduce macrovascular complications. Our aim, therefore, was to ascertain whether pioglitazone reduces macrovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods We did a prospective, randomised controlled trial in 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes who had evidence of macrovascular disease. We recruited patients from primary-care practices and hospitals. We assigned patients to oral pioglitazone titrated from 15 mg to 45 mg (n=2605) or matching placebo (n=2633), to be taken in addition to their glucose-lowering drugs and other medications. Our primary endpoint was the composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (including silent myocardial infarction), stroke, acute coronary syndrome, endovascular or surgical intervention in the coronary or leg arteries, and amputation above the ankle. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN NCT00174993. Findings Two patients were lost to follow-up, but were included in analyses. The average time of observation was 34\u00b75 months. 514 of 2605 patients in the pioglitazone group and 572 of 2633 patients in the placebo group had at least one event in the primary composite endpoint (HR 0\u00b790, 95% CI 0\u00b780\u20131\u00b702, p=0\u00b7095). The main secondary endpoint was the composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke. 301 patients in the pioglitazone group and 358 in the placebo group reached this endpoint (0\u00b784, 0\u00b772\u20130\u00b798, p=0\u00b7027). Overall safety and tolerability was good with no change in the safety profile of pioglitazone identified. 6% (149 of 2065) and 4% (108 of 2633) of those in the pioglitazone and placebo groups, respectively, were admitted to hospital with heart failure; mortality rates from heart failure did not differ between groups.",

We describe a joint GWA study ( using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K Mapping Array Set) undertaken in the British population, which has examined similar to 2,000 individuals for each of 7 major diseases and a shared set of similar to 3,000 controls. Case-control comparisons identified 24 independent association signals at P < 5 X 10(-7): 1 in bipolar disorder, 1 in coronary artery disease, 9 in Crohn's disease, 3 in rheumatoid arthritis, 7 in type 1 diabetes and 3 in type 2 diabetes. On the basis of prior findings and replication studies thus-far completed, almost all of these signals reflect genuine susceptibility effects. We observed association at many previously identified loci, and found compelling evidence that some loci confer risk for more than one of the diseases studied. Across all diseases, we identified a large number of further signals ( including 58 loci with single-point P values between 10(-5) and 5 X 10(-7)) likely to yield additional susceptibility loci. The importance of appropriately large samples was confirmed by the modest effect sizes observed at most loci identified. This study thus represents a thorough validation of the GWA approach. It has also demonstrated that careful use of a shared control group represents a safe and effective approach to GWA analyses of multiple disease phenotypes; has generated a genome-wide genotype database for future studies of common diseases in the British population; and shown that, provided individuals with non-European ancestry are excluded, the extent of population stratification in the British population is generally modest. Our findings offer new avenues for exploring the pathophysiology of these important disorders. We anticipate that our data, results and software, which will be widely available to other investigators, will provide a powerful resource for human genetics research.",

The construct of empathy involves not only the affective experience of the other person's actual or inferred emotional state but also some minimal recognition and understanding of another's emotional state. It is proposed, in the light of multiple levels of analysis including social psychology, cognitive neuroscience and clinical neuropsychology, a model of empathy that involves both bottom-up and top-down information processing underpinned by parallel and distributed computational mechanisms. The predictive validity of this model is explored with reference to clinical conditions. As many psychiatric conditions are associated with deficits or even lack of empathy, we discuss a limited number of these disorders including psychopathy/antisocial personality disorders, borderline and narcissistic personality disorders, autistic spectrum disorders, and alexithymia. We argue that future clinical investigations of empathy disorders can only be informative if behavioral, dispositional and biological factors are combined.",

National guidelines are now available for the identification, management and referral of CKD. Some causes of CKD require specific additional management directed at the underlying cause. For many patients, control of cardiovascular risk factors is the most important intervention, as these risk factors also promote progressive loss of kidney function. More intensive reduction of blood pressure and/or the use of inhibitors of the renin/angiotensin axis are recommended in the treatment of proteinuric kidney disease, including diabetic nephropathy. In these patients, treatment should be adjusted to achieve maximum reduction of urine protein excretion; dietary salt restriction is an important adjunct to drug therapy. Smoking cessation, correction of obesity, and (amongst patients with diabetes mellitus) glycaemic control are also important. The role of lipid-lowering therapy in reducing the risk of progressive CKD remains to be fully defined. Drug dose adjustment is required for those drugs that are cleared by the kidney, and care must be taken to avoid nephrotoxic drugs. Acute hypovolaemia and hypotension can further damage kidney function and should be avoided, or treated promptly. Patients with CKD require life-long follow-up; this can commonly be achieved most efficiently in the primary care setting. Symptoms are common only in advanced CKD. Patients likely to progress to established renal failure should be referred early enough to allow adequate preparation for renal replacement therapy.",

Methods From November 2003 to March 2005, we randomly assigned 903 patients with renal-cell carcinoma that was resistant to standard therapy to receive either continuous treatment with oral sorafenib (at a dose of 400 mg twice daily) or placebo; 451 patients received sorafenib and 452 received placebo. The primary end point was overall survival. A single planned analysis of progression-free survival in January 2005 showed a statistically significant benefit of sorafenib over placebo. Consequently, crossover was permitted from placebo to sorafenib, beginning in May 2005. Results At the January 2005 cutoff, the median progression-free survival was 5.5 months in the sorafenib group and 2.8 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for disease progression in the sorafenib group, 0.44;...",

We conducted post-trial monitoring to determine whether this improved glucose control persisted and whether such therapy had a long-term effect on macrovascular outcomes. Methods Of 5102 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, 4209 were randomly assigned to receive either conventional therapy (dietary restriction) or intensive therapy (either sulfonylurea or insulin or, in overweight patients, metformin) for glucose control. In post-trial monitoring, 3277 patients were asked to attend annual UKPDS clinics for 5 years, but no attempts were made to maintain their previously assigned therapies. Annual questionnaires were used to follow patients who were unable to attend the clinics, and all patients in years 6 to 10 were assessed through questionnaires...",

Poly(ADP- ribose) polymerase ( PARP) is an enzyme involved in base excision repair, a key pathway in the repair of DNA single- strand breaks(3). We show here that BRCA1 or BRCA2 dysfunction unexpectedly and profoundly sensitizes cells to the inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity, resulting in chromosomal instability, cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis. This seems to be because the inhibition of PARP leads to the persistence of DNA lesions normally repaired by homologous recombination. These results illustrate how different pathways cooperate to repair damage, and suggest that the targeted inhibition of particular DNA repair pathways may allow the design of specific and less toxic therapies for cancer.",

The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalisability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September, 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles. 18 items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies. A detailed explanation and elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the websites of  PLoS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine , and  Epidemiology . We hope that the STROBE statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies.",

Recent genome-wide scans have mapped a susceptibility locus for type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome to chromosome 3q27, where the gene encoding adiponectin is located. Here we show that decreased expression of adiponectin correlates with insulin resistance in mouse models of altered insulin sensitivity. Adiponectin decreases insulin resistance by decreasing triglyceride content in muscle and liver in obese mice. This effect results from increased expression of molecules involved in both fatty-acid combustion and energy dissipation in muscle. Moreover, insulin resistance in lipoatrophic mice was completely reversed by the combination of physiological doses of adiponectin and leptin, but only partially by either adiponectin or leptin alone. We conclude that decreased adiponectin is implicated in the development of insulin resistance in mouse models of both obesity and lipoatrophy. These data also indicate that the replenishment of adiponectin might provide a novel treatment modality for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",

Recently, the construct of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been proposed to designate an early, but abnormal, state of cognitive impairment. MCI has generated a great deal of research from both clinical and research perspectives. Numerous epidemiological studies have documented the accelerated rate of progression to dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in MCI subjects and certain predictor variables appear valid. However, there has been controversy regarding the precise definition of the concept and its implementation in various clinical settings. Clinical subtypes of MCI have been proposed to broaden the concept and include prodromal forms of a variety of dementias. It is suggested that the diagnosis of MCI can be made in a fashion similar to the clinical diagnoses of dementia and AD. An algorithm is presented to assist the clinician in identifying subjects and subclassifying them into the various types of MCI. By refining the criteria for MCI, clinical trials can be designed with appropriate inclusion and exclusion restrictions to allow for the investigation of therapeutics tailored for specific targets and populations.",

For 2 decades the public health implications of STDs have been recognized and research has detailed the impact of STDs on health particularly of women and children.  Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) for example causes infertility ectopic pregnancies maternal mortality and chronic pain and is the major reason women in many parts of the developing world seek gynecological help.  The classic STDs (such as gonorrhea syphilis chancroid and chlamydial infection) share a primary mode of transmission with HIV infection and may interact with HIV in other ways especially because the presence of a STD seems to facilitate infection with HIV.  Reduction of risky sexual behavior a primary control strategy for STDs has received a lot of attention since AIDS emerged.  Now that health education campaigns are targeted to this goal it has become apparent that we have a woeful lack of understanding of human sexual behavior and its influences.  Diagnosis and treatment of STDs is hampered by a lack of symptoms in the afflicted particularly in women a preference of patients to consult traditional healers and a lack of trained personnel and of drugs.  This last factor is aggravated by STDs which have developed a resistance to antibiotics; to compound this problem alternate drugs are more expensive.  The traditional approach to STD control should be replace by a more cost-effective and equitable integrated public health approach.  STD control should be integrated in primary health care services and with AIDS control programs.  Public health guidelines which prioritize STD activities should include 1)  primary prevention activities 2)  promotion of timely use of health services by afflicted individuals 3)  the use of simple flow-charts and standardized treatment regimes for case management with minimal use of essential drugs 4)  intensified interventions in high-risk groups and 5)  screening for syphilis in pregnant women and prevention of optithalmia neonatorum which should be integrated in maternal and child health services.  Operational research is also needed especially to develop appropriate diagnostic tools in low-resource settings.  Finally women need female-controlled safe sex methods such as the female condom and viricidal agents.  The low status of women prevents them from being able to negotiate for safe sex; yet the subclinical course of STDs in women can have disastrous consequences.",

The term norm that the economist usually uses for the purposes of such comparisons is the operation of a competitive model, that is, the flows of services that would be offered and purchased and the prices that would be paid for them. The interest in the competitive model stems partly from its presumed descriptive power and partly from its implications for economic efficiency. If a competitive equilibrium exists at all and if all commodities relevant to costs or utilities are in fact priced in the market, then the equilibrium is necessarily optimal. There is no other allocation of resources to services that will make all participants in the market better off. The most obvious distinguishing characteristics of an individual's demand for medical services is that it is not steady in origin as, for example, for food or clothing but is irregular and unpredictable. Medical services, apart from preventive services, afford satisfaction only in the event of illness, a departure from the normal state of affairs.",

The first part of this historical review deals with the physiology of APD alternans. Sections recounting the evolution of knowledge about calcium-activated ion currents and calcium transient alternans are interspersed among sections describing the growth of the so-called \u201crestitution hypothesis,\u201d which involves time-dependent recovery of potassium channels (including their passage through pre-open states) as a function of diastolic interval. Major developments are generally in chronological order, but it is necessary to move back and forth between the two theories to respect the overall time line, which runs from about l965 to the present. The concluding two sections deal with the pathophysiology of calcium transient and APD alternans during ischemia, which may be the basis for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during the initial stages of acute myocardial infarction.",

Methods: A field study to measure prices of selected medicines was undertaken in Thailand using a standardized methodology developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Health Action International (HAI). Prices of 43 medicines were measured in health facilities and pharmacies in the capital city and three districts in different parts of Thailand. Medicine prices were expressed as the ratios relative to a standard set of international reference prices (median price ratio or MPR). Results: The public sector procured generics and innovator brands at 1.46 and 3.3 MPR while patients paid 2.55 and 4.36 MPR, respectively. Private pharmacies procured lowest price generics at 1.48 MPR and innovator brands at 9.67 MPR. Because of no medicine pricing policy in Thailand, it was found that between public and private sectors, among different public hospitals, and among different private pharmacies, the same generic products were procured and sold to patients at different prices. The median mark-up for innovator brands were 31% in the public sector and 22% in the private sector. For lowest priced generics, the median mark-up were 80% in the public sector and 96% in the private sector. Different prices for the identical product were problems to the health insurance organizations in terms of reimbursement, and to patients in terms of fairness. Conclusion: The results highlight priority areas for action by the Ministry of Public Health and others in improving the drug pricing systems. The price regulation system should be implemented at every level of drug supply chain and appropriate pricing strategies should be employed.",

It has performed well clinically and, for this discussion, it has shown great promise for the treatment of many symptoms which modern medicine has associated for centuries with lung cancer. Many medicinal plants have been tested for anticancer activity such as antofine, acutiaporberine, etc. The compounds which have been isolated from these medicinal herbs include a variety of alkaloids, triterpenoids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and polysaccharides. Some of the formulas used in clinical tests have been combined with chemotherapy. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulae such as shenyi capsule and aidi injection contain numerous ingredients so that they may be considered to have anit-lung cancer activity as well as serving as immunomodulators. They have been demonstrated to ameliorate or prevent adverse effects as a result of the use of single drugs. Research on Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of lung cancer has not only been shown to aeffect lung cancer, but to also provide important methods for the study of lung cancer therapy.

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the strength of associations between BMI and different sites of cancer and to investigate differences in these associations between sex and ethnic groups. METHODS: We did electronic searches on Medline and Embase (1966 to November 2007), and searched reports to identify prospective studies of incident cases of 20 cancer types. We did random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions of study-specific incremental estimates to determine the risk of cancer associated with a 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI. FINDINGS: We analysed 221 datasets (141 articles), including 282,137 incident cases. In men, a 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI was strongly associated with oesophageal adenocarcinoma (RR 1.52, p<0.0001) and with thyroid (1.33, p=0.02), colon (1.24, p<0.0001), and renal (1.24, p <0.0001) cancers. In women, we recorded strong associations between a 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI and endometrial (1.59, p<0.0001), gallbladder (1.59, p=0.04), oesophageal adenocarcinoma (1.51, p<0.0001), and renal (1.34, p<0.0001) cancers. We noted weaker positive associations (RR <1.20) between increased BMI and rectal cancer and malignant melanoma in men; postmenopausal breast, pancreatic, thyroid, and colon cancers in women; and leukaemia, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in both sexes. Associations were stronger in men than in women for colon (p<0.0001) cancer. Associations were generally similar in studies from North America, Europe and Australia, and the Asia-Pacific region, but we recorded stronger associations in Asia-Pacific populations between increased BMI and premenopausal (p=0.009) and postmenopausal (p=0.06) breast cancers. INTERPRETATION: Increased BMI is associated with increased risk of common and less common malignancies. For some cancer types, associations differ between sexes and populations of different ethnic origins. These epidemiological observations should inform the exploration of biological mechanisms that link obesity with cancer.",

We hypothesized that a multidimensional grading system that assessed the respiratory and systemic expressions of COPD would better categorize and predict outcome in these patients. Methods We first evaluated 207 patients and found that four factors predicted the risk of death in this cohort: the body-mass index (B), the degree of airflow obstruction (O) and dyspnea (D), and exercise capacity (E), measured by the six-minute\u2013walk test. We used these variables to construct the BODE index, a multidimensional 10-point scale in which higher scores indicate a higher risk of death.

We examined the effect of introducing palliative care early after diagnosis on patient-reported outcomes and end-of-life care among ambulatory patients with newly diagnosed disease. Methods We randomly assigned patients with newly diagnosed metastatic non\u2013small-cell lung cancer to receive either early palliative care integrated with standard oncologic care or standard oncologic care alone. Quality of life and mood were assessed at baseline and at 12 weeks with the use of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy\u2013Lung (FACT-L) scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, respectively. The primary outcome was the change in the quality of life at 12 weeks. Data on end-of-life care were collected from electronic medical records. Results Of the 151 patients who underwent randomization, 27 died by 12 weeks and 107 (86% of the remaining patients) completed assessments. Patients assigned to early palliative care had a better quality of life than did patients assigned to standard care (mean score on the FACT-L scale [in which scores range from 0 to 136, with higher scores indicating better quality of life], 98.0 vs. 91.5; P = 0.03). In addition, fewer patients in the palliative care group than in the standard care group had depressive symptoms (16% vs. 38%, P = 0.01). Despite the fact that fewer patients in the early palliative care group than in the standard care group received aggressive end-of-life care (33% vs. 54%, P = 0.05), median survival was longer among patients receiving early palliative care (11.6 months vs. 8.9 months, P = 0.02). Conclusions Among patients with metastatic non\u2013small-cell lung cancer, early palliative care led to significant improvements in both quality of life and mood. As compared with patients receiving standard care, patients receiving early palliative care had less aggressive care at the end of life but longer survival.

Findings In a training set of 115 tumours, we identified a 76-gene signature consisting of 60 genes for patients positive for oestrogen receptors (ER) and 16 genes for ER-negative patients. This signature showed 93% sensitivity and 48% specificity in a subsequent independent testing set of 171 lymph-node-negative patients. The gene profile was highly informative in identifying patients who developed distant metastases within 5 years (hazard ratio 5\u00b767 (95% CI 2\u00b759-12\u00b74)), even when corrected for traditional prognostic factors in multivariate analysis (5\u00b755 (2\u00b746-12\u00b75)).

We have taken a biochemical approach towards elucidating the mechanisms underlying this genetic phenomenon. Here we show that 'loss-of- function' phenotypes can be created in cultured Drosophila cells by transfection with specific double-stranded RNAs. This coincides with a marked reduction in the level of cognate cellular messenger RNAs. Extracts of transfected cells contain a nuclease activity that specifically degrades exogenous transcripts homologous to transfected double-stranded RNA. This enzyme contains an essential RNA component. After partial purification, the sequence-specific nuclease co-fractionates with a discrete, ~25-nucleotide RNA species which may confer specificity to the enzyme through homology to the substrate mRNAs.",

Fluid resuscitation improves survival among patients with septic shock, but evidence is lacking to support the choice of either crystalloids or colloids. Methods In a multicenter, two-by-two factorial trial, we randomly assigned patients with severe sepsis to receive either intensive insulin therapy to maintain euglycemia or conventional insulin therapy and either 10% pentastarch, a low-molecular-weight hydroxyethyl starch (HES 200/0.5), or modified Ringer\u2019s lactate for fluid resuscitation. The rate of death at 28 days and the mean score for organ failure were coprimary end points. Results The trial was stopped early for safety reasons. Among 537 patients who could be evaluated, the mean morning blood glucose level was lower in the intensive-therapy group (112 mg per deciliter [6.2 mmol per liter]) than in the conventional-therapy group (151 mg per deciliter [8.4 mmol per liter], P<0.001). However, at 28 days, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the rate of death or the mean score for organ failure. The rate of severe hypoglycemia (glucose level, \u226440 mg per deciliter [2.2 mmol per liter]) was higher in the intensive-therapy group than in the conventional-therapy group (17.0% vs. 4.1%, P<0.001), as was the rate of serious adverse events (10.9% vs. 5.2%, P = 0.01). HES therapy was associated with higher rates of acute renal failure and renal-replacement therapy than was Ringer\u2019s lactate. Conclusions The use of intensive insulin therapy placed critically ill patients with sepsis at increased risk for serious adverse events related to hypoglycemia. As used in this study, HES was harmful, and its toxicity increased with accumulating doses. (ClinicalTrials. gov number, NCT00135473.)",

A major factor in its prominence as a pathogen is its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants. Here we report the complete sequence of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1. At 6.3 million base pairs, this is the largest bacterial genome sequenced, and the sequence provides insights into the basis of the versatility and intrinsic drug resistance of P. aeruginosa. Consistent with its larger genome size and environmental adaptability, P. aeruginosa contains the highest proportion of regulatory genes observed for a bacterial genome and a large number of genes involved in the catabolism, transport and efflux of organic compounds as well as four potential chemotaxis systems. We propose that the size and complexity of the P. aeruginosa genome reflect an evolutionary adaptation permitting it to thrive in diverse environments and resist the effects of a variety of antimicrobial substances. P. aeruginosa is a versatile Gram-negative bacterium that grows in soil, marshes and coastal marine habitats, as well as on plant and animal tissues 1 . It forms biofilms on wet surfaces such as those of rocks and soil 2,3 . The emergence of P. aeruginosa as a major opportunistic human pathogen during the past century may be a consequence of its resistance to the antibiotics and disinfectants that eliminate other environmental bacteria. P. aeruginosa is now a significant source of bacteraemia in burn victims, urinary-tract infections in catheterized patients, and hospital-acquired pneumo- nia in patients on respirators 4 . It is also the predominant cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis patients, whose abnormal airway epithelia allow long-term colonization of the lungs by P. aeruginosa. These infections are impossible to eradicate, in part because of the natural resistance of the bacterium to antibiotics, and ultimately lead to pulmonary failure and death. Here we report the sequencing of the genome of P. aeruginosa. The sequence is of interest because of the insights it provides into the role of this bacterium as a pathogen, and because it offers new information on the relationship between genome size, genetic complexity and ecological versatility in bacteria. At 6.3 million base pairs (Mbp), the P. aeruginosa genome is markedly larger than most of the 25 sequenced bacterial genomes. In fact, with 5,570 predicted open reading frames (ORFs), the genetic complexity of P. aeruginosa approaches that of the simple eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whose genome encodes about 6,200 proteins 5 . In contrast, P. aeruginosa has only 30-40% of the number of predicted genes present in the simple metazoans Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster 6 .",

We examined the effect of introducing palliative care early after diagnosis on patient-reported outcomes and end-of-life care among ambulatory patients with newly diagnosed disease. Methods We randomly assigned patients with newly diagnosed metastatic non\u2013small-cell lung cancer to receive either early palliative care integrated with standard oncologic care or standard oncologic care alone. Quality of life and mood were assessed at baseline and at 12 weeks with the use of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy\u2013Lung (FACT-L) scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, respectively. The primary outcome was the change in the quality of life at 12 weeks. Data on end-of-life care were collected from electronic medical records. Results Of the 151 patients who underwent randomization, 27 died by 12 weeks and 107 (86% of the remaining patients) completed assessments. Patients assigned to early palliative care had a better quality of life than did patients assigned to standard care (mean score on the FACT-L scale [in which scores range from 0 to 136, with higher scores indicating better quality of life], 98.0 vs. 91.5; P = 0.03). In addition, fewer patients in the palliative care group than in the standard care group had depressive symptoms (16% vs. 38%, P = 0.01). Despite the fact that fewer patients in the early palliative care group than in the standard care group received aggressive end-of-life care (33% vs. 54%, P = 0.05), median survival was longer among patients receiving early palliative care (11.6 months vs. 8.9 months, P = 0.02). Conclusions Among patients with metastatic non\u2013small-cell lung cancer, early palliative care led to significant improvements in both quality of life and mood. As compared with patients receiving standard care, patients receiving early palliative care had less aggressive care at the end of life but longer survival.

Fluid resuscitation improves survival among patients with septic shock, but evidence is lacking to support the choice of either crystalloids or colloids. Methods In a multicenter, two-by-two factorial trial, we randomly assigned patients with severe sepsis to receive either intensive insulin therapy to maintain euglycemia or conventional insulin therapy and either 10% pentastarch, a low-molecular-weight hydroxyethyl starch (HES 200/0.5), or modified Ringer\u2019s lactate for fluid resuscitation. The rate of death at 28 days and the mean score for organ failure were coprimary end points. Results The trial was stopped early for safety reasons. Among 537 patients who could be evaluated, the mean morning blood glucose level was lower in the intensive-therapy group (112 mg per deciliter [6.2 mmol per liter]) than in the conventional-therapy group (151 mg per deciliter [8.4 mmol per liter], P<0.001). However, at 28 days, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the rate of death or the mean score for organ failure. The rate of severe hypoglycemia (glucose level, \u226440 mg per deciliter [2.2 mmol per liter]) was higher in the intensive-therapy group than in the conventional-therapy group (17.0% vs. 4.1%, P<0.001), as was the rate of serious adverse events (10.9% vs. 5.2%, P = 0.01). HES therapy was associated with higher rates of acute renal failure and renal-replacement therapy than was Ringer\u2019s lactate. Conclusions The use of intensive insulin therapy placed critically ill patients with sepsis at increased risk for serious adverse events related to hypoglycemia. As used in this study, HES was harmful, and its toxicity increased with accumulating doses. (ClinicalTrials. gov number, NCT00135473.)",

            "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a gut-derived incretin hormone that stimulates insulin and suppresses glucagon secretion, inhibits gastric emptying, and reduces appetite and food intake. Therapeutic approaches for enhancing incretin action include degradation-resistant GLP-1 receptor agonists (incretin mimetics), and inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) activity (incretin enhancers). Clinical trials with the incretin mimetic exenatide (two injections per day or long-acting release form once weekly) and liraglutide (one injection per day) show reductions in fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations, and haemoglobin A 1c  (HbA 1c ) (1\u20132%), associated with weight loss (2\u20135 kg). The most common adverse event associated with GLP-1 receptor agonists is mild nausea, which lessens over time. Orally administered DPP-4 inhibitors, such as sitagliptin and vildagliptin, reduce HbA 1c  by 0\u00b75\u20131\u00b70%, with few adverse events and no weight gain. These new classes of antidiabetic agents, and incretin mimetics and enhancers, also expand \u03b2-cell mass in preclinical studies. However, long-term clinical studies are needed to determine the benefits of targeting the incretin axis for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.",

A major factor in its prominence as a pathogen is its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants. Here we report the complete sequence of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1. At 6.3 million base pairs, this is the largest bacterial genome sequenced, and the sequence provides insights into the basis of the versatility and intrinsic drug resistance of P. aeruginosa. Consistent with its larger genome size and environmental adaptability, P. aeruginosa contains the highest proportion of regulatory genes observed for a bacterial genome and a large number of genes involved in the catabolism, transport and efflux of organic compounds as well as four potential chemotaxis systems. We propose that the size and complexity of the P. aeruginosa genome reflect an evolutionary adaptation permitting it to thrive in diverse environments and resist the effects of a variety of antimicrobial substances. P. aeruginosa is a versatile Gram-negative bacterium that grows in soil, marshes and coastal marine habitats, as well as on plant and animal tissues 1 . It forms biofilms on wet surfaces such as those of rocks and soil 2,3 . The emergence of P. aeruginosa as a major opportunistic human pathogen during the past century may be a consequence of its resistance to the antibiotics and disinfectants that eliminate other environmental bacteria. P. aeruginosa is now a significant source of bacteraemia in burn victims, urinary-tract infections in catheterized patients, and hospital-acquired pneumo- nia in patients on respirators 4 . It is also the predominant cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis patients, whose abnormal airway epithelia allow long-term colonization of the lungs by P. aeruginosa. These infections are impossible to eradicate, in part because of the natural resistance of the bacterium to antibiotics, and ultimately lead to pulmonary failure and death. Here we report the sequencing of the genome of P. aeruginosa. The sequence is of interest because of the insights it provides into the role of this bacterium as a pathogen, and because it offers new information on the relationship between genome size, genetic complexity and ecological versatility in bacteria. At 6.3 million base pairs (Mbp), the P. aeruginosa genome is markedly larger than most of the 25 sequenced bacterial genomes. In fact, with 5,570 predicted open reading frames (ORFs), the genetic complexity of P. aeruginosa approaches that of the simple eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whose genome encodes about 6,200 proteins 5 . In contrast, P. aeruginosa has only 30-40% of the number of predicted genes present in the simple metazoans Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster 6 .",

It is unknown how much translational control is exerted by miRNAs on a genome-wide scale. We used a new proteomic approach to measure changes in synthesis of several thousand proteins in response to miRNA transfection or endogenous miRNA knockdown. In parallel, we quantified mRNA levels using microarrays. Here we show that a single miRNA can repress the production of hundreds of proteins, but that this repression is typically relatively mild. A number of known features of the miRNA-binding site such as the seed sequence also govern repression of human protein synthesis, and we report additional target sequence characteristics. We demonstrate that, in addition to downregulating mRNA levels, miRNAs also directly repress translation of hundreds of genes. Finally, our data suggest that a miRNA can, by direct or indirect effects, tune protein synthesis from thousands of genes.",
