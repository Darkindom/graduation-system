This paper gives an overview about UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) systems and their application for photogrammetric recording and documentation of cultural heritage. First the historical development of UAV systems and the definition of UAV-helicopte rs will be given. The advantages of a photogrammetric system on-board a model helicopter will be briefly discussed and compared to standard aerial and terrestrial photogrammetry. UAVs are mostly low cost systems and flexible and therefore a suitable alternative solution compared to other mobile mapping systems. A mini UAV-system was used for photogrammetric image data acquisition near Palpa in Peru. A settlement from the 13 th century AD, which was presumably used as a mine, was flown with a model helicopter. Based on the image data, an accurate 3D-model will be generated in the future. With an orthophoto and a DEM derived from aerial images in a scale of 1:7 000, a flight planning was build up. The determined flying positions were implemented in the flight control system. Thus, the helicopter is able to fly to predefined pathpoints automatically. Tests in Switzerland and the flights in Pinchango Alto showed that using the built-in GPS/INS- and stabilization units of the flight control system, predefined positions could be reached exactly to acquire the images. The predicted strip crossings and flying height were kept accurately in the autonomous flying mode.",

UAV surveys are conducted over different study sites with varying extents and flying heights in order to provide both very high resolution site-specific data and lower-resolution overviews, thus fully exploiting the large potential of the chosen UAV for multi-scale mapping purposes. Depending on the scale and area coverage, two different approaches for georeferencing are used, based on high-precision GCPs or the UAV\u2019s log file with exterior orientation values respectively. The photogrammetric image processing enables the creation of Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) and ortho-image mosaics with very high resolution on a sub-decimetre level.

However, only recently its development and progress, hindered in the past by lack of technology, made the UAV category a major area of interest for many civilian and military applications.

Propulsion types are diverse as well; from tiny electrical motors to large Turbofan engines. UAVs are used today to substitute manned aircraft in missions of reconnaissance, attack or scientific survey \u2013 in many cases with better performance, lower costs and without endangering a pilot.

For a long time there have been a large number of works to address this problem; therefore a comparative summary of them would be desirable. This paper presents a survey on the major collision avoidance systems developed in up to date publications. Each collision avoidance system contains two main parts: sensing and detection, and collision avoidance. Based on their characteristics each part is divided into different categories; and those categories are explained, compared and discussed about advantages and disadvantages in this paper.",

            "abstract": "Kite aerial photography (KAP) involves large kites for lifting cameras 50-150 m above the ground. Either soft (airfoil) or rigid (delta, rokkaku) kites may be utilized in wind ranging from 10 to 40 km/h. Various film, digital, or video imaging devices are employed in single- or dual-camera rigs for acquiring individual images, multiband photos, or stereopairs. Camera pan, tilt, and shutter are operated by radio control from the ground. Photographs may be obtained in visible and near-infrared portions of the spectrum using different film/filter combinations. Photographs can be taken in any position--vertical, low- and high-oblique, and in any orientation relative to the sun and ground object. Vertical digital KAP typically has pixel resolution of 5-10 cm, and about \u00bd to 1 hectare ground area is depicted in a single scene. Kite aerial photography is highly portable and can be operated in almost any situation with an open flying field. A crew of two is sufficient normally, one to fly the kite, the other to operate radio controls and take pictures. Low cost makes this method feasible for routine operation by small organizations, and the method is convenient for frequent photography to document environmental changes. We have utilized kite aerial photography for diverse research and commercial applications including assessment of forests and wetlands, investigations of fluvial and glacial landforms, depiction of multiview -angle reflectance phenomena, and surveys of property and construction sites. KAP has proven valuable for bridging the scale and resolution gap between ground observations and conventional airphotos and satellite images.",

            "abstract": "The routine integration of unmanned aircraft into non-segregated civil airspace is important to enable a number of current and proposed applications ranging from military and homeland security to a wide variety of research and eventually commercial purposes. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is currently undertaking a comprehensive overhaul of the National Airspace System (NAS) known as Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). NextGen will include increased automation systems for both terminal and en-route Air Traffic Control (ATC). Improvements in two-way data communication links between aircraft and ATC will facilitate the use of such automation systems. The robust integration of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) into NextGen automation systems is an integral component to meeting the far-term (2018+) NextGen vision. By determining how UAS flight operations and protocols may be different than those of traditional manned aircraft, informed decisions can be made concerning the data and interfaces required to accommodate routine UAS operations by NextGen automation systems, ultimately leading to safer and more efficient integration of UAS into non-segregated civil airspace. This paper describes many of the challenges associated with such accommodation as well as proposed solutions to address these challenges based upon construction of prototype interfaces using established UAS communication standards and envisioned ATC automation interfaces. Enhanced data formats, communication protocols and algorithms are also researched and discussed.",

UAVs can be deployed quickly and repeatedly, are less costly and safer than piloted aircraft, and can obtain very high-resolution imagery. At the Jornada Experimental Range in New Mexico, ongoing research is aimed at determining the utility of UAVs for rangeland mapping, assessment and monitoring. Digital images of arid rangelands were acquired with two UAVs that differed in size/weight, payload capacity, flight duration, GPS guidance capability and cost. The first system was a modified model airplane equipped with GPS and able to fly along preloaded waypoints and acquire images with a digital camera. The second UAV was a BAT 3 (MLB Systems) with fully autonomous flight capability and equipped with color video and digital cameras. Both units provide a data file containing GPS and elevation for each image, but the BAT also records roll, pitch and heading data. Both systems acquired high quality, high-resolution images of approximately 5 cm ground resolution (at 150 m flying height). Because the images have a small footprint (152 m x 114 m), mosaicking is required for further image analysis. Inclusion of camera calibration parameters (lens distortion, focal length, principal point) greatly increased the accuracy of the aero triangulation process and the resulting orthophotos. Due to the greater stability of the BAT and its longer flight range, the BAT imagery is better suited for analysis of larger areas than the imagery from the model airplane. However, the model airplane offers comparable image resolution and a cost effective alternative to the larger and more expensive UAV systems. Details of both systems, image acquisition and image processing results are discussed and compared.",

This paper presents a methodology for two-dimensional motion planning of a UAV using fuzzy logic. The fuzzy inference system takes information in real time about obstacles (if within the agent's sensing range) and target location and outputs a change in heading angle and speed. The FL controller was validated, and Monte Carlo testing was completed to evaluate the performance. Not only was the path traversed by the UAV often the exact path computed using an optimal method, the low failure rate makes the fuzzy logic controller (FLC) feasible for exploration. The FLC showed only a total of 3% failure rate, whereas an artificial potential field (APF) solution, a commonly used intelligent control method, had an average of 18% failure rate. These results highlighted one of the advantages of the FLC method: its adaptability to complex scenarios while maintaining low control effort.",

However, problems with safety, cost, statistical integrity, and logistics continue to impede aerial surveys from manned aircraft. The use of small, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may offer promise for addressing these problems and become a useful tool for many wildlife applications, such as for collecting low-altitude aerial imagery. During 2002 and 2003, we used a 1.5-m wingspan UAV equipped with autonomous control and sophisticated video equipment to test the potential usefulness of such an aircraft for wildlife research applications in Florida, USA. The UAV we used completed >30 missions (missions averaging 13 km linear distance covered) over 2 years before finally crashing due to engine failure. The UAV captured high-quality, progressive-scan video of a number of landscapes and wildlife species (white ibis [Eudocimus albus], other white wading birds, American alligator [Alligator mississippiensis], and Florida manatee [T...",

UAVs can be deployed quickly and repeatedly, are less costly and safer than piloted aircraft, and can obtain very high-resolution imagery. At the Jornada Experimental Range in New Mexico, ongoing research is aimed at determining the utility of UAVs for rangeland mapping, assessment and monitoring. Digital images of arid rangelands were acquired with two UAVs that differed in size/weight, payload capacity, flight duration, GPS guidance capability and cost. The first system was a modified model airplane equipped with GPS and able to fly along preloaded waypoints and acquire images with a digital camera. The second UAV was a BAT 3 (MLB Systems) with fully autonomous flight capability and equipped with color video and digital cameras. Both units provide a data file containing GPS and elevation for each image, but the BAT also records roll, pitch and heading data. Both systems acquired high quality, high-resolution images of approximately 5 cm ground resolution (at 150 m flying height). Because the images have a small footprint (152 m x 114 m), mosaicking is required for further image analysis. Inclusion of camera calibration parameters (lens distortion, focal length, principal point) greatly increased the accuracy of the aero triangulation process and the resulting orthophotos. Due to the greater stability of the BAT and its longer flight range, the BAT imagery is better suited for analysis of larger areas than the imagery from the model airplane. However, the model airplane offers comparable image resolution and a cost effective alternative to the larger and more expensive UAV systems. Details of both systems, image acquisition and image processing results are discussed and compared.",

However, as the UAV industry matures, unmanned aircraft will inevitably crash. In anticipation of these growing pains, insurance carriers must be ready. Unmanned aircraft present a unique matrix of risk endemic to the challenges of flight in the NAS. Underwriters and actuaries will be able to provide peace of mind to pilots and bystanders alike.

Field and flight tests were performed for the CsI detector in the area where  137 Cs fallout from the Chernobyl accident is 23\u201345\u00a0kBq\u00a0m \u22122 . A 3-GBq  137 Cs point source could be detected at the altitude of 50\u00a0m using a flight speed of 70\u00a0km\u00a0h \u22121  and data acquisition interval of 1\u00a0s.

The task of persistent surveillance is different from a coverage or exploration problem, in that the target area needs to be continuously searched, minimizing the time between visitations to the same region. This difference does not allow a straightforward application of most exploration techniques to the problem, although ideas from these methods can still be used. In this research we investigate techniques that are scalable, reliable, efficient, and robust to problem dynamics. These are tested in a multiple unmanned air vehicle (UAV) simulation environment, developed for this program. A semi-heuristic control policy for a single UAV is extended to the case of multiple UAVs using two methods. One is an extension of a reactive policy for a single UAV and the other involves allocation of sub-regions to individual UAVs for parallel exploration. An optimal assignment procedure (based on auction algorithms) has also been developed for this purpose. A comparison is made between the two approaches and a simplified optimal result. The reactive policy is found to exhibit an interesting emergent behavior as the number of UAVs becomes large. The control policy derived for a single UAV is modified to account for actual aircraft dynamics (a 3 degree-of-freedom nonlinear dynamics simulation is used for this purpose) and improvements in performance are observed. Finally, we draw conclusions about the utility and efficiency of these techniques.",

The use of small drones for wildlife surveys as a surrogate for manned aerial surveys is becoming increasingly attractive and has already been implemented with some success. This raises the question of how to process UAS imagery in order to determine the surface area of sampling strips within an acceptable confidence level. For the purpose of wildlife surveys, the estimation of sampling strip surface area needs to be both accurate and quick, and easy to implement. As GPS and an inertial measurement units are commonly integrated within unmanned aircraft platforms, two methods of direct georeferencing were compared here. On the one hand, we used the image footprint projection (IFP) method, which utilizes collinearity equations on each image individually. On the other hand, the Structure from Motion (SfM) technique was used for block orientation and georeferencing. These two methods were compared on eight sampling strips. An absolute orientation of the strip was determined by indirect georeferencing using ground control points. This absolute orientation was considered as the reference and was used for validating the other two methods. The IFP method was demonstrated to be the most accurate and the easiest to implement. It was also found to be less demanding in terms of image quality and overlap. However, even though a flat landscape is the type most widely encountered in wildlife surveys in Africa, we recommend estimating IFP sensitivity at an accentuation of the relief.",

One sense and avoid function is self separation, which requires that aircraft remain \u201cwell clear.\u201d An approach is proposed in this paper to treat well clear as a separation standard, thus posing it as a relative state between aircraft where the risk of collision first reaches an unacceptable level. By this approach, an analytically-derived boundary for well clear can be derived that supports rigorous safety assessment. A preliminary boundary is proposed in both time and distance for the well clear separation standard, and recommendations for future work are made. I. Introduction NE key challenge to achieving airspace access for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) is the ability to provide an acceptably safe means of compliance with federal aviation regulations that require pilots to see and avoid other aircraft. Without a pilot onboard the aircraft, UAS must utilize operational or technical means to detect and resolve potential conflicts. Several efforts are ongoing with the goal of defining required performance of sense and avoid functions. There have been recent recommendations in the U.S. 1 and internationally 2 to define the sense and avoid function as being composed of two separate functions: self separation and collision avoidance. Self separation is execution of maneuvers to remain \u201cwell clear\u201d of other aircraft. These maneuvers would typically be gentle, right-of-way compliant maneuvers well in advance of a serious conflict. Collision avoidance would be a function executed to prevent an imminent collision, typically through more aggressive maneuvers. The requirement to maintain well clear derives from regulatory language in U.S. Federal Aviation Regulations governing general flight rules. The language is insufficient to derive a quantitative performance requirement to serve as guidance for algorithm design and system evaluation. An analytical approach to defining a well clear threshold to evaluate self-separation performance is proposed in this paper. This analytical definition can be used as one component of guidance for an acceptable means for UAS to comply with the intent of FAR Part 91 governing sense",

            "abstract": "Search and exploration using multiple autonomous sensing platforms has been extensively studied in the fields of controls and artificial intelligence. The task of persistent surveillance is different from a coverage or exploration problem, in that the target area needs to be continuously searched, minimizing the time between visitations to the same region. This difference does not allow a straightforward application of most exploration techniques to the problem, although ideas from these methods can still be used. In this research we investigate techniques that are scalable, reliable, efficient, and robust to problem dynamics. These are tested in a multiple unmanned air vehicle (UAV) simulation environment, developed for this program. A semi-heuristic control policy for a single UAV is extended to the case of multiple UAVs using two methods. One is an extension of a reactive policy for a single UAV and the other involves allocation of sub-regions to individual UAVs for parallel exploration. An optimal assignment procedure (based on auction algorithms) has also been developed for this purpose. A comparison is made between the two approaches and a simplified optimal result. The reactive policy is found to exhibit an interesting emergent behavior as the number of UAVs becomes large. The control policy derived for a single UAV is modified to account for actual aircraft dynamics (a 3 degree-of-freedom nonlinear dynamics simulation is used for this purpose) and improvements in performance are observed. Finally, we draw conclusions about the utility and efficiency of these techniques.",

UAVs are widely used in military operations nowadays because of their reliability, cost effectiveness and multi-functionality. The problem we posed in this paper is the weight lifting capacity of UAVs. Improvement in weight lifting capacity may leads to adding a more function in account of UAVs. To validate this proposal, we considered many different structures of UAVs and choose Quadrotor. The payload of our Quadrotor is around 4 kg which adds function of weight lifting in military operations as well as industrial applications. Calculation of aerodynamic drag-lift forces has been done. The stresses generated in the body of quadrotor is not more than 22.5 MPa in \"Box\" sectional chassis and 22.2 MPa in \"C\" Sectional chassis as per the practical testing. To validate these results, the stress analysis of two types of body of quadrotor (\"Box\" and \"C\" section) is carried out in ANSYS static structural solver. As per the Static Structural solver the stress generated are 15.4 MPa and 16.97 MPa in \"Box\" and \"C\" sectional chassis respectively. Further analysis and fabrication of model is under process. Quadrotor can be used in safety, inspection of tool in construction industry, toxic material handling, transmitting important and emergency orders.",

Efforts during the Interwar Period, World War II, and afterward ultimately led to the development of cruise missiles such as Harpoon and Tomahawk, aerial targets, and the current family of UAVs. UAVs have the ability to transmit to the battlefield commander real-time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance information from hostile areas. They can also act as communication relays, designate targets for neutralization by other assets, or attack the targets themselves with onboard munitions and then loiter while streaming real-time battle damage information back to friendly forces\u2014all without risking the lives of an aircrew. This article provides a historical survey on the early development of select UAVs in the U.S. military and their military applications. The development of cruise missiles and UAVs is intertwined.

To maintain efficiency and safety, autonomy has to be implemented to enable the ship to operate without requiring the SCC to continuously control the ship. Communication between ship and a shore control center (SCC) is therefore critical for the unmanned ship and proper safety and security precautions are required, including sufficient redundancy and backup solutions. Communication systems should be able to supply at least 4 Megabits/second for full remote control from SCC, but reduced operation can be maintained at down to 125 kilobits/second. In autonomous mode, the required communication bandwidth will be very low. For an autonomous ship the higher bandwidth requirements are from ship to shore which is the opposite of the situation for normal ships. Cost and availability of communication is an issue. The use of technical and functional indexes will enable the SCC to monitor the status of the ship at minimum load on operators and on the communication systems. The security and integrity of information transfers is crucial and appropriate means must be taken to ensure failure tolerance and fail to safe properties of the system.",

The problem we posed in this paper is the weight lifting capacity of UAVs. Improvement in weight lifting capacity may leads to adding a more function in account of UAVs. To validate this proposal, we considered many different structures of UAVs and choose Quadrotor. The payload of our Quadrotor is around 4 kg which adds function of weight lifting in military operations as well as industrial applications. Calculation of aerodynamic drag-lift forces has been done. The stresses generated in the body of quadrotor is not more than 22.5 MPa in \"Box\" sectional chassis and 22.2 MPa in \"C\" Sectional chassis as per the practical testing. To validate these results, the stress analysis of two types of body of quadrotor (\"Box\" and \"C\" section) is carried out in ANSYS static structural solver. As per the Static Structural solver the stress generated are 15.4 MPa and 16.97 MPa in \"Box\" and \"C\" sectional chassis respectively. Further analysis and fabrication of model is under process. Quadrotor can be used in safety, inspection of tool in construction industry, toxic material handling, transmitting important and emergency orders.",

            "abstract": "Traditional manned airborne surveys are usually exp ensive and the resolution of the acquired images is often limited. The main advantage of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system acting as a photogrammetric sensor platform over more traditional manned airborne system is the high flexibility that allows image acquisition from unconventional viewpoints, the low cost in comparison with classical aerial photogrammetry and the high r esolution images obtained. Nowadays there is a nece ssity for surveying small areas and in these cases, it is not economical the use of normal large format aerial or metric cameras to acquire aerial photos, therefore, the use of UAV platforms can be very sui table. Also the large availability of digital camer as has strongly enhanced the capabilities of UAVs. The use of digital non metric cameras together with the UAV could be used for multiple applications such as aerial surveys, GIS, wildfire mapping, stability of landslides, crop monitoring, etc. The aim of this work was to develop a low cost and accurate methodology in the production of ortho photos and Digital Elevation Models (DEM). The study was conducted in the province of Almeria, south of Spain. The photogrammetric flight had an altitude of 50 m over ground, c overing an area of 5.000 m 2 approximately. The UAV used in this work was the md4-200, which is an electronic battery powered quadr ocopter UAV developed by Microdrones GmbH, Germany. It had on-board a Pextax Optio A40 digital non metric camera with 12 Megapixels. It features a 3x optical zoom lens with a focal range covering an gles of view equivalent to those of 37-111 mm lens in 35 mm format. The quadrocopter can be programmed to follow a route defined by several waypoints and actions and it has t he ability for vertical take off and landing. Proper flight geometry during image ac quisition is essential in order to minimize the num ber of photographs, avoid areas without a good coverage and make the overlaps homogeneous. The flight planning was done using the MdCockpit software, with the module waypoint editor. Flight route file was downloaded into the quadrocopter autonomous chip via cable. A total of twelve vertical images with a longitudinal and tran sversal overlapping of 60 % and 50 % respectively were taken. The digital camera was previously geometrically calibrated. Field cont rol points covering the whole studied area were def ined over the area of interest and their coordinates were measured by a GPS. Natural targets were used as field control points. The c lose range photogrammetric software Photomodeler Scanner v.7 was used in this work to calibrate the camera and to carry out the p hotogrammetric process. The software Golden Surfer was used to produce the DEM. The planimetric and the altimetric root mean squar e error (RMSE) were calculated in order to check the accuracy of the pr oducts. The RMSEx was 6 cm, the RMSEy was 4 cm and the RMSEy was 7 cm. Our preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of orthophotos and DEMs obtained from images captured from a quadrocopter using low cost photogrammetric software. A future work can be the comparison of the produ cts obtained following the route used in this study where the images are taken vertically with the products obtained with an orbi tal route where the number of images will be diminished and the photos will be ta ken oblique.",

Remote sensing can improve early detection of invading plants and make their management more efficient and less expensive. In an ongoing project in the Czech Republic, we aim at developing innovative methods of mapping invasive plant species (semi-automatic detection algorithms) by using purposely designed unmanned aircraft (UAV). We examine possibilities for detection of two tree and two herb invasive species. Our aim is to establish fast, repeatable and efficient computerassisted method of timely monitoring, reducing the costs of extensive field campaigns. For finding the best detection algorithm we test various classification approaches (object-, pixel-based and hybrid). Thanks to its flexibility and low cost, UAV enables assessing the effect of phenological stage and spatial resolution, and is most suitable for monitoring the efficiency of eradication efforts. However, several challenges exist in UAV application, such as geometrical and radiometric distortions, high amount of data to be processed and legal constrains for the UAV flight missions over urban areas (often highly invaded).

Inshore areas are where ocean and land intersect; the sea conditions and environment are complex and changeable, and human activities are frequent in these areas. Natural disasters, such as a substantial rise in sea levels, coastal erosion and transitions, and rapid flooding from tsunamis, and human development projects, pollution, and ecological damage must be thoroughly investigated, monitored, recorded, and prevented. The west coast of Taiwan, particularly the southeast coastal plain, is a highly populated narrow area; thus, field survey tools with a high degree of freedom and flexible applications are required for data collection to reach its full potential. The Taiwan Ocean Research Institute developed an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) for the \u201cLong Term Observation for Research Performed in TORI\u201d 2010 project. This USV is a platform that integrates scientific equipment, including Wi-Fi communication and a satellite-based global positioning system (GPS) with navigation images and signals, to form an internal network with onshore control bases to allow the instant acquisition of measured data and enable researchers to conduct surveys in safe conditions. USVs are appropriate for various types of inshore research and surveys, such as marine topography, sediment disposition analysis, inshore engineering measurements, and the monitoring of hydrology, water quality, and the environment. One aim of the Taiwan Ocean Research Institute (TORI) is to establish a method to use the USV for collecting inshore marine topography, hydrology, water quality, and meteorological data. Integrating field investigations of Taiwan\u2019s coastal waters will provide data for verifying numerical simulations and lead scientists to explore novel and unknown areas.",

INTRODUCTION Unmanned air vehicles (UAV) have been used for many tasks including surveillance, reconnaissance, target acquisition, relaying communications, delivering small items, working as decoy and many others.

However, only recently its development and progress, hindered in the past by lack of technology, made the UAV category a major area of interest for many civilian and military applications. Dimensions, propulsion and applications of UAVs differ from manned aircraft. Nowadays, sizes of UAVs vary from several centimeters to a wingspan of over 40\u2009m. Propulsion types are diverse as well; from tiny electrical motors to large Turbofan engines. UAVs are used today to substitute manned aircraft in missions of reconnaissance, attack or scientific survey \u2013 in many cases with better performance, lower costs and without endangering a pilot. As the widened introduction of UAVs continues, their capabilities and versatility grow, and thus present the most promising technological solution for many current and future airborne applications.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#This chapter presents a short review of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and systems.

Remote sensing can improve early detection of invading plants and make their management more efficient and less expensive. In an ongoing project in the Czech Republic, we aim at developing innovative methods of mapping invasive plant species (semi-automatic detection algorithms) by using purposely designed unmanned aircraft (UAV). We examine possibilities for detection of two tree and two herb invasive species. Our aim is to establish fast, repeatable and efficient computerassisted method of timely monitoring, reducing the costs of extensive field campaigns. For finding the best detection algorithm we test various classification approaches (object-, pixel-based and hybrid). Thanks to its flexibility and low cost, UAV enables assessing the effect of phenological stage and spatial resolution, and is most suitable for monitoring the efficiency of eradication efforts. However, several challenges exist in UAV application, such as geometrical and radiometric distortions, high amount of data to be processed and legal constrains for the UAV flight missions over urban areas (often highly invaded). The newly proposed UAV approach shall serve invasive species researchers, management practitioners and policy makers.",

Inshore areas are where ocean and land intersect; the sea conditions and environment are complex and changeable, and human activities are frequent in these areas. Natural disasters, such as a substantial rise in sea levels, coastal erosion and transitions, and rapid flooding from tsunamis, and human development projects, pollution, and ecological damage must be thoroughly investigated, monitored, recorded, and prevented. The west coast of Taiwan, particularly the southeast coastal plain, is a highly populated narrow area; thus, field survey tools with a high degree of freedom and flexible applications are required for data collection to reach its full potential. The Taiwan Ocean Research Institute developed an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) for the \u201cLong Term Observation for Research Performed in TORI\u201d 2010 project. This USV is a platform that integrates scientific equipment, including Wi-Fi communication and a satellite-based global positioning system (GPS) with navigation images and signals, to form an internal network with onshore control bases to allow the instant acquisition of measured data and enable researchers to conduct surveys in safe conditions. USVs are appropriate for various types of inshore research and surveys, such as marine topography, sediment disposition analysis, inshore engineering measurements, and the monitoring of hydrology, water quality, and the environment. One aim of the Taiwan Ocean Research Institute (TORI) is to establish a method to use the USV for collecting inshore marine topography, hydrology, water quality, and meteorological data. Integrating field investigations of Taiwan\u2019s coastal waters will provide data for verifying numerical simulations and lead scientists to explore novel and unknown areas.",

To discuss this issue, the paper proposes new control architecture for UAV using RBAC (Roll Based Access Control).

By maximizing\u00a0the accuracy of the mathematical model the resultant motion of the Quadcopter can be predicted.\u00a0This prediction can then be used to increase the accuracy, stability and time response of the\u00a0overall system.\u00a0Experiments were conducted in order to obtain the physical characteristics of the Quadcopter.\u00a0These parameters were then used to create a MATLAB model of the Quadcopter. This model was\u00a0then used to design and implement various control systems. These control systems where then\u00a0implemented in the Quadcopter and the performance compared to that of the mathematical\u00a0model.\u00a0The mathematical model was found to be capable of accurately predicting the behaviour of the\u00a0Crazy Flie under conditions involving low external influences such at wind.",

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 56 (Proceedings of the 10th International Coastal Symposium), pg \u2013 pg. Lisbon, Portugal, ISBN (Leave the number of pages blank) In the last decade we have witnessed an unprecedented development of Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) for missions with high societal impact. Future generations of UAV systems will reflect the major current trends: increased levels of autonomy, lower cost, longer endurance, and networking capabilities. Networking is one of the major trends for unmanned vehicle systems; it is also one of the enabling technologies for distributed cooperation (and computation). In mobile network systems, vehicles, sensors and operators interact through (inter-operated) communication networks. Dynamic networks of UAVs can be used in a broad range of missions like border patrol, tracking of pollution at sea, and oceanographic and environmental research. The Portuguese Air Force Academy and the School of Engineering at Porto University have been collaborating, since 2006, on the design, implementation and testing of different types of UAVs to demonstrate these technologies in a wide spectrum of military/civil missions. This is a multi-disciplinary cooperation encompassing several technological fields: advanced vision systems for identification and tracking of fixed and mobile features, cooperative control of teams of UAVs in mixed-initiative environments, sensor fusion and navigation systems. These technologies are being developed and integrated into UAV platforms for demonstration in military missions like reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition, and also in several civil missions like aerial gravimetry, aerial photography, surveillance and control of maritime traffic, fishing surveillance, and detection and control of coastal hazards. This paper reports on these developments and on the demonstrations that took place in the last two years. We report on video surveillance and environmental monitoring operations with six different types of fixed-wing UAVs (wingspans ranging from 1 to 6 meters), with autonomous take-off and landing capabilities. The smaller platforms can be easily deployed (hand-launched) while the others are more suitable for endurance and larger payloads.",

Compared with piloted aircraft, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can focus on small crop fields at lower flight altitudes than regular aircraft to perform site-specific farm management with higher precision.  They can also fill in the gap in locations where fixed winged or rotary winged aircraft are not readily available.  In agriculture, UAVs have primarily been developed and used for remote sensing and application of crop production and protection materials.  Application of fertilizers and chemicals is frequently needed at specific times and locations for site-specific management.  Routine monitoring of crop plant health is often required at very high resolution for accurate site-specific management as well.  This paper presents an overview of research involving the development of UAV technology for agricultural production management.  Technologies, systems and methods are examined and studied.  The limitations of current UAVs for agricultural production management are discussed, as well as future needs and suggestions for development and application of the UAV technologies in agricultural production management.",

Not all of such missions can be expressed as safe, goal seeking, partly because in many cases there isn't an obvious goal. Rather than developing singular solutions to each mission, we seek a generalized formulation that enables us to express a wider range of missions. Here we propose a framework that allows for multiple objectives to be considered simultaneously and discuss corresponding planning algorithms that are capable of running in realtime on autonomous air vehicles. The algorithms create a set of initial hypotheses that are then optimized by a sub-gradient based trajectory algorithm that optimizes the multiple objectives, producing dynamically feasible trajectories. We have demonstrated the feasibility of our approach with changing cost functions based on newly discovered information. We report on results in simulation of a system that is tasked with navigating safely between obstacles while searching for an acceptable landing site.",

Materials advancements have helped to increase possibilities with respect to actuation and, hence, a diversity of concepts and unimagined capabilities. The expanded role of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has provided an ideal platform for exploring these emergent morphing concepts since at this scale a greater amount of risk can be taken, as well as having more manageable fabrication and cost requirements. This review focuses on presenting the role UAVs have in morphing research by giving an overview of the UAV morphing concepts, designs, and technologies described in the literature. A presentation of quantitative information as well as a discussion of technical issues is given where possible to begin gaining some insight into the overall assessment and performance of these technologies.",

            "abstract": "Recent shifts in tactical defense operations have led to a need for improved capabilities in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Several vehicle types such as the Predator are currently operational, and numerous smaller specialized vehicles are under development. Many of the vehicles under development require the ability to stow their wings and control surfaces into very small volumes to permit gun launch or packaging into aircraft mounted aerial drop assemblies. One technology that has shown promise in achieving this goal is the inflatable wing. Inflatable wings have been demonstrated in many applications over the past five decades, including aircraft, UAVs, airships, and missile stabilization surfaces. Recent advancements in high strength fibers and rigidizable materials have enabled higher performance designs for modern application. The inclusion of \u201csmart materials\u201d has provided the opportunity to impart a multi-functional capability to inflatable wings. Such materials include electronictextiles, which provide the potential for the integration of numerous functions directly into the structure of the wing such as shape modification for control and morphing, power generation and storage, antennas, and sensing.",

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 56 (Proceedings of the 10th International Coastal Symposium), pg \u2013 pg. Lisbon, Portugal, ISBN (Leave the number of pages blank) In the last decade we have witnessed an unprecedented development of Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) for missions with high societal impact. Future generations of UAV systems will reflect the major current trends: increased levels of autonomy, lower cost, longer endurance, and networking capabilities. Networking is one of the major trends for unmanned vehicle systems; it is also one of the enabling technologies for distributed cooperation (and computation). In mobile network systems, vehicles, sensors and operators interact through (inter-operated) communication networks. Dynamic networks of UAVs can be used in a broad range of missions like border patrol, tracking of pollution at sea, and oceanographic and environmental research. The Portuguese Air Force Academy and the School of Engineering at Porto University have been collaborating, since 2006, on the design, implementation and testing of different types of UAVs to demonstrate these technologies in a wide spectrum of military/civil missions. This is a multi-disciplinary cooperation encompassing several technological fields: advanced vision systems for identification and tracking of fixed and mobile features, cooperative control of teams of UAVs in mixed-initiative environments, sensor fusion and navigation systems. These technologies are being developed and integrated into UAV platforms for demonstration in military missions like reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition, and also in several civil missions like aerial gravimetry, aerial photography, surveillance and control of maritime traffic, fishing surveillance, and detection and control of coastal hazards. This paper reports on these developments and on the demonstrations that took place in the last two years. We report on video surveillance and environmental monitoring operations with six different types of fixed-wing UAVs (wingspans ranging from 1 to 6 meters), with autonomous take-off and landing capabilities. The smaller platforms can be easily deployed (hand-launched) while the others are more suitable for endurance and larger payloads.",

Several states have enacted laws limiting or prohibiting the use of UAS by state or local governmental agencies. #R##N#Privacy concerns are valid, however a full prohibition of UAS technology would limit law enforcement agencies from taking advantage of a valuable public safety tool.

            "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles have been developed and applied to support agricultural production management.  Compared with piloted aircraft, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can focus on small crop fields at lower flight altitudes than regular aircraft to perform site-specific farm management with higher precision.  They can also fill in the gap in locations where fixed winged or rotary winged aircraft are not readily available.  In agriculture, UAVs have primarily been developed and used for remote sensing and application of crop production and protection materials.  Application of fertilizers and chemicals is frequently needed at specific times and locations for site-specific management.  Routine monitoring of crop plant health is often required at very high resolution for accurate site-specific management as well.  This paper presents an overview of research involving the development of UAV technology for agricultural production management.  Technologies, systems and methods are examined and studied.  The limitations of current UAVs for agricultural production management are discussed, as well as future needs and suggestions for development and application of the UAV technologies in agricultural production management.",

            "abstract": "Here we consider the problem of low-flying rotorcraft that must perform various missions such as navigating to specific goal points while avoiding obstacles, looking for acceptable landing sites or performing continuous surveillance. Not all of such missions can be expressed as safe, goal seeking, partly because in many cases there isn't an obvious goal. Rather than developing singular solutions to each mission, we seek a generalized formulation that enables us to express a wider range of missions. Here we propose a framework that allows for multiple objectives to be considered simultaneously and discuss corresponding planning algorithms that are capable of running in realtime on autonomous air vehicles. The algorithms create a set of initial hypotheses that are then optimized by a sub-gradient based trajectory algorithm that optimizes the multiple objectives, producing dynamically feasible trajectories. We have demonstrated the feasibility of our approach with changing cost functions based on newly discovered information. We report on results in simulation of a system that is tasked with navigating safely between obstacles while searching for an acceptable landing site.",
