Such algorithms have been developed to arrive at near-optimum solutions to large-scale optimization problems, for which traditional mathematical techniques may fail. This paper compares the formulation and results of five recent evolutionary-based algorithms: genetic algorithms, memetic algorithms, particle swarm, ant-colony systems, and shuffled frog leaping. A brief description of each algorithm is presented along with a pseudocode to facilitate the implementation and use of such algorithms by researchers and practitioners. Benchmark comparisons among the algorithms are presented for both continuous and discrete optimization problems, in terms of processing time, convergence speed, and quality of the results. Based on this comparative analysis, the performance of EAs is discussed along with some guidelines for determining the best operators for each algorithm. The study presents sophisticated ideas in a simplified form that should be beneficial to both practitioners and researchers involved in solving optimization problems.",

The procedure simulates the decision-making processes of ant colonies as they forage for food and is similar to other adaptive learning and artificial intelligence techniques such as Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms. Modifications are made to the ACO algorithm used to solve the traditional traveling salesman problem in order to allow the search of the multiple routes of the VRP. Experimentation shows that the algorithm is successful in finding solutions within 1% of known optimal solutions and the use of multiple ant colonies is found to provide a comparatively competitive solution technique especially for larger problems. Additionally, the size of the candidate lists used within the algorithm is a significant factor in finding improved solutions, and the computational times for the algorithm compare favorably with other solution methods. q 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the key issues in bearing prognostics is to detect the defect at its incipient stage and alert the operator before it develops into a catastrophic failure. Signal de-noising and extraction of the weak signature are crucial to bearing prognostics since the inherent deficiency of the measuring mechanism often introduces a great amount of noise to the signal. In addition, the signature of a defective bearing is spread across a wide frequency band and hence can easily become masked by noise and low frequency effects. As a result, robust methods are needed to provide more evident information for bearing performance assessment and prognostics.#R##N##R##N#This paper introduces enhanced and robust prognostic methods for rolling element bearing including a wavelet filter based method for weak signature enhancement for fault identification and Self Organizing Map (SOM) based method for performance degradation assessment.

These have been initiatives from researchers, software developers and standards committees. Now large property owners are becoming aware of the benefits of moving IT tools from specific applications towards more comprehensive solutions. This study addresses the state of building information models and the conditions necessary for them to become more widely used. It is a qualitative study based on information from a number of international experts and has asked a series of questions about the feasibility of BIMs, the conditions necessary for their success, and the role of standards with particular reference to the IFCs. Some key statements were distilled from the diverse answers received and indicate that BIM solutions appear too complex for many and may need to be applied in limited areas initially. Standards are generally supported but not applied rigorously and a range of these are relevant to BIM. Benefits will depend upon the building procurement methods used and there should be special roles within the project team to manage information. Case studies are starting to appear and these could be used for publicity. The IFCs are rather oversold and their complexities should be hidden within simple-to-use software. Inevitably major questions remain and property owners may be the key to answering some of these. A framework for presenting standards, backed up by case studies of successful projects, is the solution proposed to provide better information on where particular BIM standards and solutions should be applied in building projects.",

In this paper, a new approach for automated recognition of project 3D Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model objects in large laser scans is presented, with significant improvements compared to the one originally proposed in Bosche et al. (in press) [11]. A more robust point matching method is used and registration quality is improved with the implementation of an Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based fine registration step. Once the optimal registration of the project's CAD model with a site scan is obtained, a similar ICP-based registration algorithm is proposed to calculate the as-built poses of the CAD model objects. These as-built poses are then used for automatically controlling the compliance of the project with respect to corresponding dimensional tolerances. Experimental results are presented with data obtained from the erection of an industrial building's steel structure. They demonstrate the performance in real field conditions of the model registration and object recognition algorithms, and show the potential of the proposed approach for as-built dimension calculation and control.",

Aimed at capturing such functional knowledge that can easily be applied to other domains, we developed an ontological framework to systematically describe it. It includes six kinds of knowledge about functionality, i.e. two types of functional models, two types of organization of generic knowledge, and two ontologies of functionality. This paper reports on the successful deployment of the framework in a production company. The Plant and Production Systems Engineering Division of Sumitomo Electric Industries has used our framework to share functional design knowledge on production systems since May, 2001. An empirical evaluation by Sumitomo's engineers was unanimously positive. They said that this framework enabled them to make implicit knowledge possessed by each designer explicit and to share it among team members. This paper discusses some successful use-cases in tasks such as a design review, a patent application, and solving a quality problem. We also discuss effects of our ontological framework as a consistent viewpoint for capturing implicit functional knowledge and as a conceptual interlingua among designers. The limitations of our framework are also discussed.",

However, extending the construction project control system to job sites is considered inefficient since construction sites are unconventional practice. Integrating promising information technologies such as radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, mobile devices-PDA and web portals can help improve the effectiveness and convenience of information flow in construction supply chain control systems. Radio frequency identification is appropriate for various construction applications, and provides cost savings through increased speed and accuracy of data entry. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a RFID-based supply chain management application called the mobile construction RFID-based dynamic supply chain management (M-ConRDSCM) system in construction projects, demonstrating that it responds efficiently and enhances the information flow among offices and sites in a construction supply chain environment. The M-ConRDSCM system is then applied to a selected case study involving a High-Tech factory building in Taiwan to verify the proposed methodology and demonstrate the effectiveness of information sharing of project control in the construction phase. The advantage of the M-ConRDSCM system lies not only in improving work efficiency for on-site engineers, but also in providing dynamic operation control and management to enable project participants to control the whole project.

This paper presents a methodology to optimize building shapes in plan using the genetic algorithm. The building footprint is represented by a multi-sided polygon. Different geometrical representations for a polygon are considered and evaluated in terms of their potential problems such as epistasis, which occurs when one gene pair masks or modifies the expression of other gene pairs, and encoding isomorphism, which occurs when chromosomes with different binary strings map to the same solution in the design space. Two alternative representations are compared in terms of their impact on computational effectiveness and efficiency. An optimization model is established considering the shape-related variables and several other envelope-related design variables such as window ratios and overhangs. Life-cycle cost and life-cycle environmental impact are the two objective functions used to evaluate the performance of a green building design. A case study is presented where the shape of a typical floor of an office building defined by a pentagon is optimized with a multi-objective genetic algorithm.",

We propose a functional concept ontology which provides a rich vocabulary representing functions together with clear definitions grounded on behavior. The ontology enables the automatic identification system to make the search in the functional space tractable and to screen out meaningless interpretations. Furthermore, the ontology includes a new category of functional concepts named meta-functions representing conceptual categories of interdependency between functions. It plays a crucial role in consolidation of functions to give criteria of grouping functions, that is, identity of consolidated functions. It enables the identification system to generate such functional hierarchies that do not correspond to physical structure.",

Although many industries use the current FMEA technique, it has many limitations and problems. Risk is measured in terms of Risk Priority Number (RPN) that is a product of occurrence, severity, and detection difficulty. Measuring severity and detection difficulty is very subjective and with no universal scale. RPN is also a product of ordinal variables, which is not meaningful as a proper measure. This paper addresses these shortcomings and introduces a new methodology, Life Cost-Based FMEA, which measures risk in terms of cost. Life Cost-Based FMEA is useful for comparing and selecting design alternatives that can reduce the overall life cycle cost of a particular system. Next, a Monte Carlo simulation is applied to the Cost-Based FMEA to account for the uncertainties in: detection time, fixing time, occurrence, delay time, down time, and model complex scenarios. A case study of a large scale particle accelerator shows the advantages of the proposed approach in predicting life cycle failure cost, measuring risk and planning preventive, scheduled maintenance and ultimately improving up-time. q 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Many engineering domain theories are organized and embedded within CAD and CAE tools and engineering activities can be formalized as modeling operations to them. Since most of domain theories deal with the physical world and can be associated with physical concepts, a physical concept ontology can form a common ontology to integrate engineering models that are formed based on domain theories. This paper reports a physical ontology-based support system for knowledge intensive engineering called Knowledge Intensive Engineering Framework (KIEF) to integrate multiple engineering models and to allow more flexible use of them. First, the paper describes the physical ontology as the core of KIEF and an ontology-based reasoning system, called a pluggable metamodel mechanism, to integrate and maintain relationships among these models. The pluggable metamodel mechanism uses a metamodel that represents the designer's mental model about a design object as a concept network model. The designer builds and decomposes a functional hierarchy from functional specifications with an FBS (Function-Behavior-State) modeler. He/She then maps the functional hierarchy into a metamodel using physical features that are building blocks for conceptual design. Then, the pluggable metamodel mechanism enriches the information contained in the metamodel by using causal dependency knowledge about the physical world and by building and analyzing various engineering models. We demonstrate the power of KIEF by illustrating a design case performed on KIEF.",

Four different localization algorithms (MinMax, Maximum Likelihood, Ring Overlapping Circle RSSI and k-Nearest Neighbor) were evaluated at both locations. The results indicate that the tested localization algorithms performed less well on the construction jobsite than they did in the operating building. The simple MinMax algorithm has better performance than other algorithms, with average errors as low as 1.2\u00a0m with a beacon density of 0.186/m2. The Ring Overlapping Circle RSSI algorithm was also shown to have good results and avoids implementation difficulties of other algorithms. k-Nearest Neighbor algorithms, previously explored by other construction researchers, have good accuracy in some test cases but may be particularly sensitive to beacon positioning.",

For this purpose, a customer-oriented approach has accordingly been proposed and investigated in this study. It concerns both breadth and depth perspectives of customer requirements acquisition as well as customer and marketing analysis. This prototype system comprises two interrelated components, namely, the CRE and the customer/marketing analysis (CMA) modules. The process starts from the voice of customers and ends with the identified opportunities from marketing analysis. In the prototype system, the laddering technique has been employed to enable CRE via the so-called customer attributes hierarchy (CAM).

We describe a normative theory of analogy-based design called model-based analogy (or MBA) that transfers design patterns from source cases to target problems. In particular, for the domain of physical devices, we identify a class of design patterns, called generic teleological mechanisms (or GTMs), that specify generic functional relations in, and abstract causal structure of, a class of devices. While GTMs provide a partial content account of analogical transfer, MBA provides a process account of acquisition, access, and use of GTMs. In particular, MBA shows how structure-behavior-function (SBF) models of specific designs enable the acquisition of GTMs, which are represented as behavior-function (BF) models, and how goals of adapting familiar designs to meet new design requirements result in the access, transfer, and use of previously learned GTMs. We describe how the IDeAL system instantiates and evaluates the MBA theory.",

However, pavement distress detection (cracks, potholes, etc.) is mostly performed manually, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Existing methods either rely on complete 3D surface reconstruction, which comes along with high equipment and computation costs, or make use of acceleration data, which can only provide preliminary and rough condition surveys. In this paper we present a method for automated pothole detection in asphalt pavement images. In the proposed method an image is first segmented into defect and non-defect regions using histogram shape-based thresholding. Based on the geometric properties of a defect region the potential pothole shape is approximated utilizing morphological thinning and elliptic regression. Subsequently, the texture inside a potential defect shape is extracted and compared with the texture of the surrounding non-defect pavement in order to determine if the region of interest represents an actual pothole. This methodology has been implemented in a MATLAB prototype, trained and tested on 120 pavement images. The results show that this method can detect potholes in asphalt pavement images with reasonable accuracy.",

This paper focus on the presentation of different applications of GENE_ARCH, an evolution-based GDS aimed at helping architects to achieve energy-efficient and sustainable architectural solutions. The system applies goal-oriented design, combining a genetic algorithm (GA) as the search engine, with the DOE2.1E building energy simulation software as the evaluation module. Design evaluation is based on energy spent for heating, cooling, ventilation and artificial lighting in the building, and on sustainability issues like greenhouse gas emissions associated with the embodied energy of construction materials. The GA can work either as a standard GA or as a Pareto GA, for multicriteria search and optimization. In order to provide a broad view of the capabilities of the software, different applications are discussed: (1) standard GA: testing and validating the software; (2) standard GA: incorporation of architecture design intentions, using a building by architect Alvaro Siza; (3) Pareto GA: choice of construction materials, considering cost, building energy use, and embodied energy; (4) Pareto GA: application to Siza's building, considering thermal and lighting behavior separately; (5) standard GA: shape generation with single objective function; (6) Pareto GA: shape generation with multicriteria evaluation; (7) Pareto GA: application to an urban and housing context.

Recently, a key element of this integrated geospatial information to emerge is detailed geometrical and semantic information about buildings. In parallel, Building Information Models (BIMs) of today have the capacity for storing and representing such detailed geometrical and semantic information. In this context, the research aimed to investigate the applicability of BIMs in geospatial environment by focusing specifically on these two domains; site selection and fire response management. In the first phase of the research two use case scenarios were developed in order to understand the processes in these domains in a more detailed manner and to establish the scope of a possible software development for transferring information from BIMs into the geospatial environment. In the following phase of the research two data models were developed - a Schema-Level Model View and a geospatial data model. The Schema-Level Model View was used in simplifying the information acquired from the BIM, while the geospatial data model acted as the template for creating physical files and databases in the geospatial environment. Following this, three software components to transfer building information into the geospatial environment were designed, developed, and validated. The first component served for acquiring the building information from the BIM, while the latter two served for transforming the information into the geospatial environment. The overall research demonstrated that it is possible to transfer (high level of geometric and semantic) information acquired from BIMs into the geospatial environment. The results also demonstrated that BIMs provide a sufficient level and amount of (geometric and semantic) information (about the building) for the seamless automation of data management tasks in the site selection and fire response management processes.",

Current estimates show that China will need over 3billion RFID tags to satisfy demand in the year 2009. The applications for RFID patents have spread across a very diverse range of inventions and in the future it is likely that most products manufactured in China will contain an RFID tag. China's RFID industry has grown along with the demand and researchers are making significant technological advances. In this research, patent data from the State Intellectual Property Office of the People's Republic of China (SIPO) have been used to explore RFID technology development and its trends. Patent abstracts containing the keyword and phrase ''RFID'' and ''Radio Frequency Identification'' were collected for analysis, content extraction, and clustering. In total, 1389 patents from the SIPO database covering the years 1995-2008 were retrieved and archived for analysis. Patents provide exclusive rights and legal protection for inventors, play an important role in the development and fair diffusion of technology, and contain detailed specifications necessary to define and protect the boundaries of an invention. Through patent analysis, companies monitor the development of technology and evaluate the position of potential competitors in the market. This research introduce a methodology which combines patent content clustering and technology life cycle forecasting to find a niche space of RFID technology development in China. A patent content clustering method is used to cluster different patent documents into homogenous groups, and then technology forecasting is applied to evaluate possible market opportunities for future inventors and investors. The results suggest that the cluster called RFID wireless communication devices has entered the saturation stage and thus provides limited opportunity for development. Four other clusters; RFID concepts and applications, RFID architecture, RFID tracking implementation, and RFID transmission apparatus, have entered the mature stage. The RFID frequency and waves cluster appears to be in early growth stage with good development potential. Since the technology related to basic RFID concepts and devices has reached a mature stage in China, the research and development seems to be targeting the improvement of the RFID frequencies and waves as a means to develop more reliable RFID systems and applications.",

The paper presents definitions of the semantics of the topological operators within, contain, touch, overlap, disjoint and equal in 3D space by using the 9-intersection model. It further describes a possible implementation of the topological operators by means of an octree-based algorithm. The recursive algorithm presented in this article relies on a breadth-first traversal of the operands' octree representations and the application of rules that are based on the color of the octants under examination. Because it successively increases the discrete resolution of the spatial objects employed, the algorithm enables the user on the one hand to handle topological relationships in a fuzzy manner and on the other hand to trade-off between computational effort and the required accuracy. The article also presents detailed investigations on the runtime performance of the developed algorithm.",

Requirements analysis and corresponding technology deployment and testing were performed for three types of ETO components through different life-cycle phases.

            "abstract": "Application of genetic algorithms to optimization of complex problems can lead to a substantial computational effort as a result of the repeated evaluation of the objective function(s) and the population-based nature of the search. This is often the case where the objective function evaluation is costly, for example, when the value is obtained following computationally expensive system simulations. Sometimes a substantially large number of generations might be required to find optimum value of the objective function. Furthermore, in some cases, genetic algorithm can face convergence problems. In this paper, a hybrid optimization algorithm is presented which is based on a combination of the neural network and the genetic algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, a back-propagation neural network is used to improve the convergence of the genetic algorithm in search for global optimum. The efficiency of the proposed computational methodology is illustrated by application to a number of test cases. The results show that, in the proposed hybrid method, the integration of the neural network in the genetic algorithm procedure can accelerate the convergence of the genetic algorithm significantly and improve the quality of solution.",

This has not promoted the diffusion of KBE in the world of industry and academia, neither has it contributed to enhancing the level of understanding of its technological fundamentals. The scope of this paper is to offer a broad technological review of KBE in the attempt to fill the current information gap. The artificial intelligence roots of KBE are briefly discussed and the main differences and similarities with respect to classical knowledge based systems and modern general purpose CAD systems highlighted. The programming approach, which is a distinctive aspect of state-of-the-art KBE systems, is discussed in detail, to illustrate its effectiveness in capturing and re-using engineering knowledge to automate large portions of the design process. The evolution and trends of KBE systems are investigated and, to conclude, a list of recommendations and expectations for the KBE systems of the future is provided.",

I argue that this field of engineering requires a special setup of the optimization model that considers the uniqueness of buildings, and allows the designer to interact with the optimization in order to assess qualities of aesthetics, expression, and building function. For this reason, the approach applies a performance optimization based on resource consumption extended by preference criteria. Furthermore, building design-specific components serve for the decomposition and an interactive way of working. The component scheme follows the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) as a common Building Information Model (BIM) standard in order to allow a seamless integration into an interactive CAD working process in the future. A representative case study dealing with a frame-based hall design serves to illustrate these considerations. An N-Square diagram or Design Structure Matrix (DSM) represents the system of components with the disciplinary dependencies and workflow of the analysis.

The paper presents in-depth definitions of the semantics of two new directional models for extended 3D objects, the projection-based and the halfspace-based model, by using point-set theory notation. It further describes the possible implementation of directional operators using a newly developed space-partitioning data structure called slot-tree, which is derived from the objects' octree representation. The slot-tree allows for the application of recursive algorithms that successively increase the discrete resolution of the spatial objects employed and thereby enables the user to trade-off between computational effort and the required accuracy.

The constructed neural network architectures were capable of satisfactorily estimating the manufacturing lead times (MLT) for orders simultaneously processed in a four-machine job shop. The MLTs produced by the developed ANN models turned out to be as valid as the data generated from three well-known simulation packages, i.e. Arena, SIMAN, and ProModel. The ANN outputs proved not to be substantially different from the results provided by other valid models such as SIMAN and ProModel when compared against the adopted baseline, Arena.

An interpretive (subjectivist) stance is adopted so as to provide a holistic understanding and interpretation of organizational KM practice, research and models. Three generations of KM are identified and discussed. To sum up, to be effective organizations need not only to negotiate their migration from a knowledge sharing (first generation) to a knowledge nurturing (second generation) culture, but also to create sustained organizational and societal values. The latter form the third generation of KM and represent key challenges faced by modern organizations in the AEC industry. An evolutionary KM framework is provided that presents the three proposed generations of KM in terms of three dimensions that factor in (a) the capability of individuals, teams and organizations in the sector, (b) ICT evolution and adoption patterns, and (c) construction management philosophies.

As consequence, their real behavior is hard to predict; such difficulties have important effects on the reliability of damage detection. Such situations encourage the enhancement of traditional approximate structural assessments through in-service measurements and interpretation of monitoring data. While some proposals have recently been made, in general, no current methodology for detection of anomalous behavior from measurement data can be reliably applied to complex structures in practical situations. This paper presents two new methodologies for model-free data interpretation to identify and localize anomalous behavior in civil engineering structures. Two statistical methods (i) moving principal component analysis and (ii) moving correlation analysis have been demonstrated to be useful for damage detection during continuous static monitoring of civil structures. The algorithms are designed to learn characteristics of time series generated by sensor data during a period called the initialization phase where the structure is assumed to behave normally. This phase subsequently helps identify those behaviors which can be classified as anomalous. In this way the new methodologies can effectively identify anomalous behaviors without explicit (and costly) knowledge of structural characteristics such as geometry and models of behavior. The methodologies have been tested on numerically simulated elements with sensors at a range of damage severities. A comparative study with wavelet and other statistical analyses demonstrates superior performance for identifying the presence of damage.",

Transparency in the food supply chain is essential to guarantee food quality and provenance to all users of food and food products. Intensified information exchange and integrated information systems involving all chain actors are needed to achieve transparency with respect to a multitude of food properties.

Major elements are addressed that support transparency to consumers, the government and food companies, which are considered the claimants of transparency. Elements considered to be enablers of transparency are governance mechanisms, quality and safety standards and information exchange. The paper specifies these transparency claimants and enablers for food supply chains and identifies major information system functions and information technology applications needed to comply with transparency demands.

For any particular working exchange for some sub-domain of building construction, a set of model view definitions (MVD) is required to specify exactly what information should be exchanged, and in what form and structure the IFC entities are to be used. Defining model view definitions requires principle decisions and workarounds because the IFC itself does not address a number of semantic issues comprehensively. Some of the issues identified and discussed include the typing of objects, instances, geometry, relationships, and rules, which are supported in the IFC schema, and the complexities of exchanging such information accurately between applications. This paper advances the idea of MVD Concepts as an object-oriented and modular mechanism for embedding semantic meaning in model views. We conclude that although the IFC product model schema is richly expressive, it lacks formal definition of its entities, attributes, and relationships. To achieve standardized and re-usable model views, further research towards a modular and logical framework based on formal specification of IFC concepts is recommended.

            "abstract": "Construction activities performed by workers are usually repetitive and physically demanding. Execution of such tasks in awkward postures can strain their body parts and can result in fatigue, injuries or in severe cases permanent disabilities. In view of this, it is essential to train workers, before the commencement of any construction activity. Furthermore, traditional worker monitoring methods are tedious, inefficient and are carried out manually whereas, an automated approach, apart from monitoring, can yield valuable information concerning work-related behavior of worker that can be beneficial for worker training in a virtual reality world. Our research work focuses on developing an automated approach for posture estimation and classification using a range camera for posture analysis and categorizing it as ergonomic or non-ergonomic. Using a range camera, first we classify worker's pose to determine whether a worker is 'standing', 'bending', 'sitting', or 'crawling' and then estimate the posture of the worker using OpenNI middleware to get the body joint angles and spatial locations. A predefined set of rules is then formulated to use this body posture information to categorize tasks as ergonomic or non-ergonomic.",

The framework implements genetic algorithms to solve (1) unconstrained and constrained single objective optimization problems, and (2) unconstrained multi-objective optimization problems.

            "abstract": "This paper presents results of the first phase of the research project ''Serious Human Rescue Game'' at Technische Universitat Darmstadt. It presents a new serious gaming approach based on Building Information Modeling (BIM) for the exploration of the effect of building condition on human behavior during the evacuation process. In reality it is impossible to conduct rescue tests in burning buildings to study the human behavior. Therefore, the current methods of data-collecting for existing evacuation simulation models have limitations regarding the individual human factors. To overcome these limitations the research hypothesis is that the human behavior can be explored with a serious computer game: The decisions of a person during the game should be comparable to decisions during an extreme situation in the real world. To verify this hypothesis, this paper introduces a serious gaming approach for analyzing the human behavior in extreme situations. To implement a serious game, developers generally make use of 3D-modeling software to generate the game content. After this, the game logic needs to be added to the content with special software development kits for computer games. Every new game scenario has to be built manually from scratch. This is time-consuming and a great share of modeling work needs to be executed twice (e.g., 3D-modeling), at first by the architect for the parametric building model and the second time by the game designer for the 3D-game content. The key idea of the presented approach is to use the capabilities of BIM together with engineering simulations (fire, smoke) to build realistic serious game scenarios in a new and efficient way. This paper presents the first phase results of the research project mainly focusing on the conceptual design of the serious game prototype. The validation concept is also presented. The inter-operability between building information modeling applications and serious gaming platforms should allow different stakeholders to simulate building-related scenarios in a new, interactive and efficient way.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we discuss the benefits derived by combining parametric modeling and genetic algorithms to achieve a performance oriented process in design, with specific focus on architectural design. The key role played by geometry in architecture is discussed in relation to performance oriented design, in which evaluations based on engineering criteria are integrated into the conceptual phase of the design. The performance attained by a specific geometric solution is considered along with its complexity in an interdisciplinarity process. A specific case study using large roofs is presented as an example. Enabling the designer to automatically generate a large range of alternative design solutions is a great advantage offered by parametric modeling in supporting geometric design explorations. However, this in turn presents the difficulty of how to evaluate the resulting myriad of generated alternatives. ParaGen is presented as a tool to support the exploration of the parametric design alternatives. ParaGen combines parametric modeling, performance simulation software and genetic algorithms, together with a database to store and retrieve the solutions for subsequent exploration. The design exploration is enhanced by means of the interaction of the designer with the process. This serves two objectives. Firstly, it addresses the genetic algorithm based creation of design solutions, while still focusing on a given fitness function. Secondly, it facilitates knowledge extraction from the generated solutions. A description of the tool and its possible uses by designers is provided. Applications of this tool are illustrated for both education and research, with specific reference to two examples in the field of modular long span roofs. The first case study has been developed as part of a teaching exercise in which ParaGen is used to explore the morphology of a dome based on structural performance. The second case study is derived from a research project which deals with solar energy transmission, and concerns the solar heat gain and daylight transmittance of a long span roof.",

To further enhance the accuracy of wafer lot output time prediction, an intelligent hybrid system is constructed in this study. Firstly, the concept of input classification is applied to Chen's fuzzy back propagation network (FBPN) approach in this study by pre-classifying wafer lots with the k-means (kM) classifier before predicting the output times with FBPN. Examples belonging to different categories are then learned with different FBPNs but with the same topology. Secondly, the future release plan of the fab, which is influential but has been ignored in traditional approaches, is also incorporated in the intelligent hybrid system. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, production simulation has been applied in this study to generate test examples. According to experimental results, the prediction accuracy of the intelligent hybrid system was significantly better than those of six approaches: BPN, case-based reasoning (CBR), FBPN, look-ahead FBPN, evolving fuzzy rules (EFR), and kM-FBPN without look-ahead in most cases by achieving a 17-47% (and an average of 34%) reduction in the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) over the comparison basis - BPN.",

The paper consists of two parts. In the first part ontologies and their use are discussed, and a methodology for developing ontologies is explored. In the second part, three very different types of ontology are developed in accordance with the methodology. Each of the ontologies captures a different conceptual facet of the engineering design domain, described at a quite different level of abstraction than the others. The process of developing ontologies is illustrated in a practical way and the application of these ontologies for supporting the capture of the engineering design requirement is described as a means of demonstrating the general potential of ontologies.",

However, most of the reported ANN approaches are only limited to recognize single basic patterns. Different from these approaches, this paper presents a hybrid approach by integrating wavelet method with ANNs for on-line recognition of CCPs including concurrent patterns. The main advantage of this approach is its capability of recognizing coexisted or concurrent patterns without training by concurrent patterns.

However, many barriers exist to their interoperability and there is little interaction between these islands of information. As part of moving building data to the cloud there is a critical need to reflect on the design of cloud-based data services and how they are designed from an interoperability perspective. If new cloud data services are designed in the same manner as traditional building management systems they will suffer from the data interoperability problems. Linked data technology leverages the existing open protocols and W3C standards of the Web architecture for sharing structured data on the web. In this paper we propose the use of linked data as an enabling technology for cloud-based building data services. The objective of linking building data in the cloud is to create an integrated well-connected graph of relevant information for managing a building.

The process involved extracting a feature vector to represent the handwritten digit based on the center of gravity and a set of vectors to the boundary points of the digit object. The feature vector is scale-, translation-, and rotation-invariant. The extracted feature vector is fed to a PNN, which in turn classifies it as one of the nine digits. A set of experiments were conducted to test the performance of the system under different angles between the vectors from the centroid to the boundary of the digit object. A 30\u00b0 angle results in a 99.72% recognition rate with a short feature vector of 12 entries. This study is meant to be a seed toward building a recognition system for Arabic language characters.",

The co-registration of 3D datasets is normally performed in two steps: coarse registration followed by fine registration. Focusing on the coarse registration, model-scan registration has been well investigated in the past, but it is shown in this article that the context of the AEC/FM industry presents specific (1) constraints that make fully-automated registration very complex and often ill-posed, and (2) advantages that can be leveraged to develop simpler yet effective registration methods.#R##N##R##N#This paper thus presents a novel semi-automated plane-based registration system for coarse registration of laser scanned 3D point clouds with project 3D models in the context of the AEC/FM industry. The system is based on the extraction of planes from the laser scanned point cloud and project 3D/4D model. Planes are automatically extracted from the 3D/4D model. For the point cloud data, two methods are investigated. The first one is fully automated, and the second is a semi-automated but effective one-click RANSAC-supported extraction method. In both cases, planes are then manually but intuitively matched by the user. Experiments, which compare the proposed system to software packages commonly used in the AEC/FM industry, demonstrate that at least as good registration quality can be achieved by the proposed system, in a simpler and faster way. It is concluded that, in the AEC/FM context, the proposed plane-based registration system is a compelling alternative to standard point-based registration techniques.",

The product technologies covered by patent claims are protected by law, and the quality of the patent insures against infringement by competitors while increasing the worth of the invention. Thus, patent quality analysis provides a means by which companies determine whether or not to customize and manufacture innovative products. Since patents provide significant financial protection for businesses, the number of patents filed is increasing at a fast pace. Companies which cannot process patent information or fail to protect their innovations by filing patents lose market competitiveness. Current patent research is needed to estimate the quality of patent documents. The purpose of this research is to improve the analysis and ranking of patent quality. The first step of the proposed methodology is to collect technology specific patents and to extract relevant patent quality performance indicators. The second step is to identify the key impact factors using principal component analysis. These factors are then used as the input parameters for a back-propagation neural network model. Patent transactions help judge patent quality and patents which are licensed or sold with intellectual property usage rights are considered high quality patents. This research collected 283 patents sold or licensed from the news of patent transactions and 116 patents which were unsold but belong to the technology specific domains of interest. After training the patent quality model, 36 historical patents are used to verify the performance of the trained model. The match between the analytical results and the actual trading status reached an 85% level of accuracy. Thus, the proposed patent quality methodology evaluates the quality of patents automatically and effectively as a preliminary screening solution. The approach saves domain experts valuable time targeting high value patents for R&D commercialization and mass customization of products.",

The MCDM strategy is initially developed for the case of design governed by n=2 objective criteria. It is then extended to design governed by n>2 objective criteria, by introducing the concept of primary and aggregate criteria. It is proved that, from among the theoretically infinite number of feasible designs forming the Pareto front for a design problem governed by n independent objective criteria, there exists a unique Pareto-compromise design that represents a mutually agreeable tradeoff between all n criteria. This remarkable result is illustrated for a flexural plate design governed by n=2 criteria, a bridge maintenance-intervention protocol design governed by n=3 criteria, and a media centre envelop design governed by n=11 criteria.",

Two different network topologies are tested over data simulated by a commissioned simulator of a nuclear reactor: a feed-forward topology and a recurrent topology, where the additional network inputs are considered as delayed activation of output units. The later approach shows better generalization performance for the detection and isolation of a number of security related faults.

            "abstract": "The conceptual development of a Management Information System to support decision making on construction projects across all management levels within the owner and the contractor organizations is introduced. The system is designed as a distributed information and service platform. The backbone of the system is a layered ontology framework. Along with the information system, a novel approach to process and multi-model driven construction management is developed that allows for sharing distributed, yet interrelated, engineering and management application models in so called multi-models. A major challenge of the system is the management of the information and model logistics as well as the interdependencies among the application models. In order to support the retrieval of information from different project phases, domains and organizations and their combination in coherent multi-models, an ontology framework is developed. It defines the overall information space of the application models describing the application models content and their links in multi-models as well as the collaboration processes within the virtual organization of the project. The proposed system represents a paradigm shift. The information space is no longer product-model-centric. Central to the model-based information space is the process model that interrelates application model views contained in multi-models required for specific planning, production and analysis tasks. The activities are considered the enabler to semi-automatically combine dedicated information pieces of existing application models in new multi-models. Therefore we have identified the instantiation of activities and their combination to valid process chains to be the bottleneck to make the process and multi-model driven construction management efficient. As a consequence, we develop a new process and multi-model generation method, which is based on process modules formalized in description logics. The process modules combine distinct methods of Reference Process Modelling and Business Process Objects. In the generated processes, related application models, and populated multi-models are hierarchically structured (1) to support the utilization of project information by different actors of the hierarchical project organization and (2) to handle engineering and management knowledge and decisions piecewise during process generation in accordance to the hierarchy levels of the involved decision makers, thereby reducing the overall complexity of decision making. The paper discusses: (1) the main components of the system for interlinking and sharing models and information, (2) the ontology-based multi-model framework and the basics for the hierarchical structuring of the models, and (3) the generation of integrated process models.",

Design structure matrix (DSM), a structured method which has advantages on representing and analysing interaction relations among system elements, is considered to be a suitable means to capture and manage the system-level design knowledge. The captured knowledge through DSM can improve understanding the design routes and design history by linking designed items to rationales, decisions and assumptions. Meanwhile, the captured knowledge through DSM could assist designers to predict changes on existing solutions, and to reuse the existing solutions in new projects. The main outcome of this paper is focused on how to capture and trace the design knowledge through single-domain DSM and multi-domain DSMs, respectively.

Estimators must recognize the design conditions that affect construction costs and customize the cost estimate accordingly. Estimators have different preferences for how and when to adjust a project\u2019s activities, resources, and resource productivity rates that form the basis of a cost estimate. Current tools and methodologies lack ways to help estimators customize construction cost information according to their preferences and the particular features in a given design. This paper describes the process we formalized to customize a project\u2019s activities, resources, and resource productivity rates based on a project-independent representation of estimators\u2019 rationale and a project-specific feature-based product model. The formal process creates an integrated model that explicitly relates features, activities, resources, costs and the estimator\u2019s rationale. Our tests show that this process enables a software prototype to generate and maintain cost estimates quickly, consistently, and accurately for feature-based product models. q 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents an automated stereo vision-based method, as an alternative and inexpensive solution, to producing a sparse Euclidean 3D point cloud of an infrastructure scene utilizing two video streams captured by a set of two calibrated cameras. In this process SURF features are automatically detected and matched between each pair of stereo video frames. 3D coordinates of the matched feature points are then calculated via triangulation. The detected SURF features in two successive video frames are automatically matched and the RANSAC algorithm is used to discard mismatches. The quaternion motion estimation method is then used along with bundle adjustment optimization to register successive point clouds. The method was tested on a database of infrastructure stereo video streams. The validity and statistical significance of the results were evaluated by comparing the spatial distance of randomly selected feature points with their corresponding tape measurements.",

Many classification methods have been proposed in the literature to tackle this problem. Statistical and neural network based approaches are among the most popular paradigms. However, most of these methods produce so-called ''hard'' classifiers, those generate decisions without any accompanying confidence measure. In contrast, ''soft'' classifiers, such as those designed using fuzzy set theoretic approach; produce a measure of support for the decision (and also alternative decisions) that provides the analyst with greater insight. In this paper, we propose a method of building credit-scoring models using fuzzy rule based classifiers. First, the rule base is learned from the training data using a SOM based method. Then the fuzzy k-nn rule is incorporated with it to design a contextual classifier that integrates the context information from the training set for more robust and qualitatively better classification. Further, a method of seamlessly integrating business constraints into the model is also demonstrated.",

The paper focuses in particular on the generic ontology of the POP model, which specifies the related functional requirements, designed forms and predicted, observed and desired behaviors of the defined POP elements. With collateral drawings, models, analyses and explanations, the project specific POP model becomes the schematic and initial detailed design for the project. We describe use of the tripod method for the preliminary design of a large commercial building project. While large generic building project ontologies exist, e.g. the Industry Foundation Classes, we find that our ontology is so simple that teams using any design tools and methods can use it today, and it is helpful. We interpret our results as early evidence that the Tripod engineering process of VDC, Extreme Collaboration and use of a generic POP ontology together enable a design team to build a new integrated multidisciplinary project design model very rapidly.

This paper introduces a new direction in structural control: the use of computational methods and explicitly defined knowledge to improve serviceability and maintenance of civil structures. The objectives of such structures, called intelligent structures, are to maintain and improve structural performance by recognizing changes in behaviors and loads, adapting the structural geometry to meet defined goals, and using past events to improve future performance. A computational framework based on intelligent control methodology is presented that combines reasoning from explicit knowledge, search, learning and planning to illustrate a vision for intelligently controlled civil structures. This is applied to enable global shape control of an adjustable tensegrity structure using a combination of simulated annealing search, dynamic relaxation analysis and structural measurements. Active tensegrity structures are modular, reusable cable structures that do not require expensive anchorages or steep slopes. This provides an innovative solution for temporary structures. Particularly, when used for exhibitions, they could become part of an exhibition, rather than just house one. As part of a multi-stage project, results presented in this paper demonstrate the feasibility of building an intelligent tensegrity structure.",

This research studies the forecast accuracy of long and short product lifecycle datasets using simple logistic, Gompertz, and the time-varying extended logistic models. The performance of the models was evaluated using the mean absolute deviation and the root mean square error. Time series datasets for 22 electronic products were used to evaluate and compare the performance of the three models. The results show that the time-varying extended logistic model fits short product lifecycle datasets 70% better than the simple logistic and the Gompertz models. The findings also show that the time-varying extended logistic model is better suited to predict market capacity with limited historical data as is typically the case for short lifecycle products.",

One of the key factors in product development concerns the understanding and management of complex relationships between customers' needs and technical requirements. Usually these complex relationships are expressed using imprecise descriptions in the form of natural linguistic terms. Frequently, quality function deployment (QFD) is employed to manage design information and assist decision-making in human centered product development. This work proposes a rough set based QFD approach to manage the aforementioned imprecise design information in product development. A novel concept known as rough number^*, which is derived from the basic notions of rough sets, is proposed to manage the imprecise design information in QFD analysis. A case study on a bicycle design is used to illustrate the approach proposed. The result shows that the new approach proposed can effectively manage the imprecise design information and facilitate decision-making in product development.",

Poor materials management has been identified as a major source of low construction productivity, cost overrun and delays. Lack of active, accurate and integrated information flow from material planning, inventory, site use to monitoring and control is a major contributor to such problems. However, it is difficult to obtain such accurate information actively due to the nature of the industry, particularly for large or material intensive projects such as oil or water pipe-laying projects. This paper presents a Radio Frequency Identification system (RFID) facilitated construction material management system which is developed to tackle this problem. This latest technology helps project teams to collect material storage and usage information in an active and accurate way. Additionally, it facilitates the flow of information through the construction materials management process focusing on dynamic material planning, ordering and monitoring. The developed system is being implemented in a water-supply project.",

The number of criteria in the test problems are two, three and four. Multicriteria optimization is applied to generate the alternatives, among which a preferred solution is to be searched by the decision making methods. Six methods have been selected for comparison: the weighted sum method, the weighted product method, VIKOR, TOPSIS, PROMETHEE II, and a procedure based on the PEG-theorem. The numerical study on the test problems indicate that in most cases, the methods provide different solutions. The PEG-procedure tends to find a well-balanced solution, where none of the criteria is emphasized.

This demographic shift will create a huge increase in demand for domestic and health-care services and this in turn has the potential to create a major new market for domestic service robots that can assist with the care and support of the elderly and infirm. However, unlike industrial robots, assistive service robots are still under-developed and are not widely deployed. We analyse the nature of the requirements for assistive robotics for the elderly and argue that traditional 'industrial' robot engineering approaches are either inappropriate or inadequate to tackle the key problem areas, which we identify as: safety, adaptivity, long-term autonomy of operation, user-friendliness and low costs. A key issue is user acceptability and this paper explores how seemingly difficult and possibly conflicting design requirements can be integrated in a human-centred approach. We develop an approach to the design of autonomous assistive robots for the home, with emphasis on the user and the tasks to be performed. We then introduce some design principles and apply these to a simplified case study. The case study was implemented as a concrete illustration, and a series of experiments are reported. The demonstration shows, (a) how existing software techniques can be combined in a synthesis that satisfies several key design ideas, (b) how a software architecture can provide a flexible and extensible substrate for the integration of the design, and (c) how this approach can be sensitive to the concept of user 'empathy' that is characteristic of these applications. By highlighting significant design issues and suggesting different approaches, we hope assistive robotics will be better able to address the novel demands of assistive applications in health-care situations.",

A significant problem remains the effort which must be expended during ontology construction. This involves collecting the domain-related vocabularies, developing the domain concept hierarchy, and defining the properties of each concept and the relationships between concepts. Recently several engineering handbooks have described detailed domain knowledge by organizing the knowledge into categories, sections, and chapters with indices in the appendix. This paper proposes the extraction of concepts, instances, and relationships from a handbook of a specific domain to quickly construct base domain ontology as a good starting point for expediting the development process of more comprehensive domain ontology. The extracted information can also be reorganized and converted into web ontology language format to represent the base domain ontology. The generation of a base domain ontology from an Earthquake Engineering Handbook is used to illustrate the proposed approach.

However, while sensors tend to generate noisy and incomplete quantitative data, reasoning often requires crisp symbolic knowledge. The gap between sensing and reasoning is quite wide, and cannot in general be bridged in a single step. Instead, this task requires a more general approach to integrating and organizing multiple forms of information and knowledge processing on different levels of abstraction in a structured and principled manner. We propose knowledge processing middleware as a systematic approach to organizing such processing. Desirable properties are presented and motivated. We argue that a declarative stream-based system is appropriate for the required functionality and present DyKnow, a concrete implemented instantiation of stream-based knowledge processing middleware with a formal semantics. Several types of knowledge processes are defined and motivated in the context of a UAV traffic monitoring application. In the implemented application, DyKnow is used to incrementally bridge the sense-reasoning gap and generate partial logical models of the environment over which metric temporal logical formulas are evaluated. Using such formulas, hypotheses are formed and validated about the type of vehicles being observed. DyKnow is also used to generate event streams representing for example changes in qualitative spatial relations, which are used to detect traffic violations expressed as declarative chronicles.",

            "abstract": "Safe and efficient operation of cranes requires not only good planning, but also sufficient and appropriate support in real time. Due to the dynamic nature of construction sites, unexpected changes in site layout may create new obstacles for the crane that can result in collisions and accidents. Previous research on construction equipment motion planning focuses on off-line support, which considers static environment or predictable obstacles. These plans may not fit the reality when the environment has any change. In this case on-site safety and efficiency can be affected. In this research, a motion planning algorithm is proposed to efficiently generate safe and smooth paths for crane motions while taking into account engineering constraints and the path quality. Path smoothness is taken into account to provide a realistic path for cranes and to reduce unnecessary movements. A dynamic motion planning algorithm is proposed to ensure safety during the execution stage by quickly re-planning and avoiding collisions. In addition, an anytime algorithm is proposed to search for better solutions during a given time period by improving path smoothness and by reducing path execution time. The proposed algorithms are compared with other available algorithms to evaluate their performance in terms of planning and re-planning time and the cost of the path. Based on the literature review, this is the first time that dual-tree RRT algorithms have been applied to crane motion planning.",

Mathematical tools such as graphical models, scheduling techniques, operations research, and simulation have enabled engineers to create models that represent activities, resources, and the environment under which a project is taking place. Traditionally, most simulation paradigms use static or historical data to create computer interpretable representations of real engineering systems. The suitability of this approach for modeling construction operations, however, has always been a challenge since most construction projects are unique in nature as every project is different in design, specifications, methods, and standards. Due to the dynamic nature and complexity of most construction operations, there is a significant need for a methodology that combines the capabilities of traditional modeling of engineering systems and real time field data collection. This paper presents the requirements and applicability of a data-driven modeling framework capable of collecting and manipulating real time field data from construction equipment, creating dynamic 3D visualizations of ongoing engineering activities, and updating the contents of a discrete event simulation model representing the real engineering system. The developed framework can be adopted for use by project decision-makers for short-term project planning and control since the resulting simulation and visualization are completely based on the latest status of project entities.",

Construction supply chains usually consist of numerous participants and are complex in structure. Representing construction supply chains using a network model can help understand the complexity, support re-configuration, identify the bottlenecks, and prioritize company's resources, as well as add values to the management of construction projects. Using a case example on the mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) processes in a construction project, this paper demonstrates the modeling of construction supply chains using the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) framework developed by the Supply Chain Council (SCC). The SCOR modeling framework provides a structured and systematic way to model and decompose a supply chain from conceptual representation to process element specification. The SCOR framework is commonly used by corporations for strategic planning of their supply chains. This paper further presents a model-based service oriented framework that leverages the SCOR models for performance monitoring of construction supply chains. In the supply chain management and monitoring framework each supply chain process element is implemented as a discrete web service component. The framework is built on a service oriented collaborative system, namely SC Collaborator, that we have developed using web service technology, open standards, and open source technologies.",

A novel hybrid methodology consisting of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is proposed. Utilizing AHP in SWOT analysis diminishes one of the main deficiencies of this strategic approach that is the restriction of employing quantitative calculation to evaluate the factors that affect the decision. AHP method improves the quantitative information basis of strategic decision-making processes. The traditional AHP requires exact judgments, but due to the complexity and uncertainty involved in real world decision problems, it is sometimes unrealistic or even impossible to require exact judgments. Consequently, a commonly used decision-making method, fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) is suggested. FAHP's connection to SWOT yields a novel hybrid method for partitioning of MTO/MTS products. At the end, the proposed fuzzy AHP-SWOT methodology is validated through a real case study.",

The primary contribution of the presented work is the design and implementation of a dynamic user-viewpoint tracking scheme in which mobile users' spatial context is defined not only by their position (i.e., location), but also by their three-dimensional head orientation (i.e., line of sight). This allows the identification of objects and artifacts visible in a mobile user's field of view with much higher accuracy than was possible by tracking position alone. For outdoor applications, a georeferencing based algorithm has been developed using the Global Positioning System (GPS) and magnetic orientation tracking devices [5] to track a user's dynamic viewpoint. For indoor applications, this study explored the applicability of wireless technologies, in particular Indoor GPS, for dynamic user position tracking in situations where GPS is unavailable. The objectives of this paper are to describe the details of the three-stage-algorithm that has been designed and implemented, and to demonstrate the extent to which positioning technologies such as GPS and Indoor GPS can be used together with high-precision orientation trackers to accurately interpret the fully-qualified spatial context of a mobile user in challenging environments such as those found on construction sites.

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis on how the accuracy is affected by multiple factors, which include region geometry, target distribution, ranging-error distribution, and landmark layout. The performance metrics are the expected mean squared error (MSE) and the expected Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) over the entire localization region. The optimal landmark layouts were first obtained for all the combinations of other factors, and then the impact of individual factors on the localization accuracy was analyzed and discussed. By combining the theoretical analysis and Monte Carlo simulation, it was discovered that (1) the optimal landmark layouts follow simple empirical deployment rules; (2) the performance generally improves as the target distribution is more centering in the region; (3) the performance for rectangular geometries decreases as the aspect-ratio increases; (4) a higher landmark number can improve localization accuracy, but the beneficial result becomes negligible if more than 8 landmarks are used. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the results from a preliminary RFID localization experiment are in agreement with the findings from the simulation.",

The World Wide Web provides even greater opportunity to reuse such information from disparate sources. Moreover, if the information is digitized it can to a large extent be processed automatically. However, information sharing requires the availability of proper formal standards. Ontologies provide such standards. Creating an ontology of units of measure is a crucial first step in unambiguously exchanging and processing quantitative information. The next step is to make this ontology available for software applications. In this paper we evaluate prevailing ontologies of units by comparing them to a semi-formal description of the domain of units of measure. This description was drafted from textual descriptions of standards in the field. An important result of the analysis is that existing ontologies only define subsets of the necessary concepts and relations identified in our reference description. We therefore propose a new ontology, called OM (Ontology of units of Measure and related concepts). The ontology is based on the description and the corresponding parts of the analyzed ontologies. OM defines the complete set of concepts in the domain as distinguished in the textual standards. As a result the ontology can answer a wider range of competency questions than the existing approaches do. Moreover, to make OM available for arbitrary software systems, we have developed a number of web services that offer a standardized interface. Three applications demonstrate the usefulness of OM and its services. First, a web application checks dimension and unit consistency of formulas. Second, an engineering application for agricultural supply chains computes product respiration quantities and measures. Third, a Microsoft Excel add-in assists in data annotation and unit conversion. Preliminary user evaluations indicate that OM and the associated services provide a useful component for software applications in science and engineering.",

The simulation environments for such a paradigm, therefore, need to take into account the cooperation between design teams, i.e. supporting multidisciplinary simulation in a distributed environment. However, current simulation tools can not fulfil this requirement as they have been developed to solve the specific problems from different disciplines. Although it's already possible to perform multidisciplinary simulations by using several tools together, it is very difficult to implement it when these tools are distributed on the Internet. A solution which can support the integration of distributed simulation models at run-time is presented, involving a computational infrastructure and a high-level modelling approach. Specifically, the infrastructure is constructed by a novel combination of two distributed computing techniques to implement the synchronization of distributed models, as well as to ensure the interoperability at run-time. In addition, a model-driven approach is developed to bridge the high-level model of a simulation system and the infrastructure which implements this model. The solution is evaluated by making a comparison with other approaches, as well as by developing a prototype tool. It's shown in the evaluation that (1) it is viable to develop multidisciplinary simulations in a distributed environment using this solution; (2) the model-driven approach allows designers to focus only on the high-level structure of a design without getting concerned with the details of the infrastructure.",

The proposed process fulfills the need for radical innovation through enriching heuristic thinking. It is a useful methodology that adds value to products in terms of technological functions, form perceptions, and holistic usability. A proposal of therapy bike design for cerebral palsy children is demonstrated using the new process. Through case demonstration, designers could enhance products with human-centered values while coping with market uncertainty effectively. The applicability of the vision-oriented approach for innovative product design is verified.",

These views contain information that is structured for their specific tasks. Engineers generally construct these views based on information contained in other engineers' views. Traditionally, engineers have manually constructed these views using pencils and more recently with computational tools like computer-aided drafting (CAD). Manually constructing and integrating views is often difficult, time-consuming, and error-prone. Newer project model approaches attempt to predetermine and automatically construct many useful task-specific views but these approaches are proving difficult to implement due to the multidisciplinary, constructive, iterative, and unique character of AEC projects. Current project modeling approaches lack adequately simple, formal, generic, expressive methods that engineers can use to automatically construct a new dependent view from information in one or many source views. In this paper, we formalize reusable reasoning modules, called Perspectors, which engineers can use to automatically construct a task-specific engineering view, called a Perspective, from other Perspectives. We motivate and retrospectively validate this approach using engineering test cases from the design and construction of the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Through implementation of a prototype, we give empirical evidence that engineers can select from a potentially small number of pre-defined, reusable, geometric Perspectors, or program new Perspectors, and easily compose them into directed graph structures, called Narratives, to construct and control the integration of useful dependent geometric Perspectives more quickly and accurately than current practice and theory allows. Perspectors are intended to enable engineers from multiple disciplines to engage in novel, automated, and integrated design and analysis by easily yet formally constructing and integrating Perspectives from other Perspectives.",

Events can be created dynamically by any active agent in the environment. Each event may potentially require collaboration or resources from one or more other agents. The allocation of resources to the event will be negotiated iteratively until a compromise is found. The framework consists of a user preference model, an evaluation or utility function, and a negotiation protocol. The negotiation protocol is used to implement a distributed negotiation algorithm, called  Nstar  (N \u2217 ). N \u2217  is based conceptually on the A \u2217  algorithm for optimal search but extended for distributed negotiation. N \u2217  is a general distributed negotiation algorithm that makes use of  negotiation strategies  to find solutions that meet different negotiation objectives. For example, it can use a utility optimizing strategy to find the solution that maximizes average utilities of individual agents. Alternatively, it can select a time optimizing strategy to locate a \u2018quick\u2019 feasible solution. The negotiation protocol also performs conflict resolution using a form of iterative repair that  renegotiates  events which have conflicts. A special case of this framework was used in our MAFOA (mobile agents for office automation) environment to perform agent-based meeting scheduling. A computer simulation test bed was built to simulate the scheduling of hundreds of randomly generated meetings using our N \u2217  algorithm.",

This paper presents a new method to solve this problem. In the proposed method, Angle Modulated Particle Swarm Optimization (AMPSO) is utilized to find islanding solutions for large-scale power systems due to its high computational efficiency. First, desired generator groups are obtained using the slow coherency algorithm. AMPSO is then used to optimize a fitness function defined according to both generation/load balance and similarity to the desired generator grouping. In doing so, the resulting islanding solutions provide good static and dynamic stability. Simulations of power systems of different scales demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

The proposed system comprises four agents, namely a port planning manager (PPM), a berth control agent (BCA), a shuttle allocation agent (SAA) and a yard storage agent (YSA). These agents communicate and cooperate with one another to work out the schedule for berth allocation and requirements for shuttles. Basically, the PPM maintains all the necessary information and provides a negotiation and communication locale for the BCA, SAA and YSA, which represent the berths, the shuttles and the container yard, respectively, to resolve their conflicts under its supervision. With the help of a GA-enhanced dynamic scheduler, the BCA attempts to optimise the berth allocation schedule using the data such as ship arrival information retrieved from the PPM. As soon as the SAA receives the schedule from the BCA, it proceeds to check for the availability of shuttles and work out the requirement for shuttles. On the other hand, the YSA generates the yard storage allocation schedule and the truck/train schedule for the transportation of containers. A case study is conducted to illustrate the capability of the distributed agent system. It has been shown that the proposed system is able to successfully generate the schedules for both the BCA and the SAA.",

However, the current dominant approach to analysis and evaluation of design proposals requires the creation of a separate building model for each kind of evaluation. This typically involves using a BIM tool to prepare the data for a specific type of analysis to obtain design feedback. Most of the effort lies in modifying the building model to support the analysis required. When dealing with multiple evaluations, this process is time consuming, greatly reducing the design benefits of BIM. We propose a system architecture to facilitate analysis and feedback in architectural design, based on post-processing design-oriented building models. The post-processing automatically adapts the building model to the needs of the specific analysis, where multiple analyses can be run from the same building model. We outline the methods for realizing such design interoperability. By utilizing geometric and attribute relationships and semantics, data subsets are identified and aggregated. We present an example where the design of a class of buildings - federal courthouses, is evaluated in terms of multiple analyses: programmatic spaces, building circulation, energy consumption, and preliminary cost. These analyses are performed by post-processing a single BIM model. The method is applicable to both API-based direct interfaces as well as open-standard building models.",

            "abstract": "Design knowledge can be acquired from various sources and generally requires an integrated representation for its effective and efficient re-use. Though knowledge about products and processes can illustrate the solutions created (know-what) and the courses of actions (know-how) involved in their creation, the reasoning process (know-why) underlying the solutions and actions is still needed for an integrated representation of design knowledge. Design rationale is an effective way of capturing that missing part, since it records the issues addressed, the options considered, and the arguments used when specific design solutions are created and evaluated. Apart from the need for an integrated representation, effective retrieval methods are also of great importance for the re-use of design knowledge, as the knowledge involved in designing complex products can be huge. Developing methods for the retrieval of design rationale is very useful as part of the effective management of design knowledge, for the following reasons. Firstly, design engineers tend to want to consider issues and solutions before looking at solid models or process specifications in detail. Secondly, design rationale is mainly described using text, which often embodies much relevant design knowledge. Last but not least, design rationale is generally captured by identifying elements and their dependencies, i.e. in a structured way which opens the opportunity for going beyond simple keyword-based searching. In this paper, the management of design rationale for the re-use of design knowledge is presented. The retrieval of design rationale records in particular is discussed in detail. As evidenced in the development and evaluation, the methods proposed are useful for the re-use of design knowledge and can be generalised to be used for the retrieval of other kinds of structured design knowledge.",

This approach has advantages over the traditional \u2018prescriptive\u2019 code-based approach for assessing acceptability of designs, which is normal practice today for assessing wheelchair accessibility. The prescriptive method can be ambiguous, contradictory, complex, and unduly restrictive in practice, and it can be ad hoc and difficult to implement as a computer application. The performance-based approach directly models the actual possible behaviors of an artifact (in this case, wheelchair motion) that are related to the functional intent of the designed system (a building) and (hopefully) to the specification of a prescriptive building code. This paper presents example cases from architectural practice to illustrate the use of robot motion-planning techniques for wheelchair accessibility analysis. This application is an example of using modern computational methods in support of knowledge-intensive engineering. The simulation method has broad applicability within engineering design.

Many prior green design research studies have focused on complete disassembly of an end-of-life product to recover valuable components. However, complete disassembly is often not practical or cost effective if only a few components will be recovered and recycled from a given product. Selective disassembly sequence planning focuses on disassembling only one or more selected components from a product for reuse, recycling, remanufacturing, and maintenance. This paper presents a rule-based recursive method for finding a near-optimal heuristic selective disassembly sequence for green design. Most prior methods either enumerate all solutions or use stochastic random methods to generate solutions. Enumerative or stochastic methods often require tremendous computational resources while, at the same time, they often fail to find realistic or optimal solutions. On the contrary, the proposed method establishes certain heuristic disassembly rules to eliminate uncommon or unrealistic solutions. In addition, rather than considering geometric constraints for each pair of components, the developed method only considers geometric relationships between a part and its neighboring parts. As a result, the developed method can effectively find a near-optimal heuristic solution while greatly reducing computational time and space.",

This study presents a novel cloud approach that, focusing on China's special construction requirements, proposes a series of as-built BIM (building information modeling) tools and a self-organised application model that correlates project engineering data and project management data through a seamless BIM and BSNS (business social networking services) federation. To achieve a logically centralised single-source data structure, a unified data model is constructed that integrates two categories of heterogeneous databases through the adoption of handlers. Based on these models, key technical mechanisms that are critical to the successful management of large amounts of data are proposed and implemented, including permission, data manipulation and file version control. Specifically, a dynamic Generalised List series is proposed to address the sophisticated construction file versioning issue. The proposed cloud has been successfully used in real applications in China. This research work can enable data sharing not only by individuals and project teams but also by enterprises in a consistent and sustainable way throughout the life of a construction project. This system will reduce costs for construction firms by providing effective and efficient means and guides to complex project management, and by facilitating the conversion of project data into enterprise-owned properties.",

This is a great challenge since today it requires significant human expertise supported, only partially, by computer-aided approaches. This paper introduces a new approach and framework for an autonomous design-to-fabrication system that integrates cognitive capabilities, such as reasoning from knowledge models and autonomous planning, and embeds these in the machines themselves to automatically fabricate customized parts. The framework integrates into a common process automatic workpiece selection using an ontology, generative CNC machining planning using shape grammars and automated fixture design, based on a novel flexible fixture device hardware. Initial results are given for the machining planning approach applied to 2.5D parts with a defined approach direction and the prototyped fixture device is presented. The advantages and potential of the framework stem mainly from applying the principles of cognitive technical systems to a fabrication system to develop an integrated and on-line approach. The methods are developed specifically for use on the machine shop floor to take advantage of the possibility to update and extend knowledge models to reflect current fabrication capabilities and to adapt to changes in the environment and re-plan during operation. Finally, future directions, including integrating on-line perception and learning, are discussed, which are required to create a truly flexible and cognitive fabrication system.",

Better integration will need to assist design rather than automate design, allowing a spontaneous, creative and flexible process that acknowledges the expertise of the design team members. This research investigates and contrasts emergent option spaces and their inherent uncertainties in an artificial setting (student design studios) and in real-life scenarios (commercial design project case studies).

The method is based on a simulation of construction works, taking into account the available resources and the interdependencies between individual tasks. The simulation is realized by means of a discrete-event simulation software originally created for plant layout in the manufacturing industry. Due to the fact that the fixed process chains provided are too rigid to model the spontaneous construction task sequences, a constraint module that dynamically selects the following task has been incorporated. Constraint module input data is formed by activity packages comprising of the affected building element, the required material, machine and manpower resources, as well as the technological pre-requisites of the activity to be performed. Since manual creation of the large set of activity packages is laborious and error-prone, a 3D model-based application has been developed which allows the interactive assignment of construction methods to individual building elements. To facilitate this process, a level-of-detail approach has been implemented which allows the user to successively refine both the process model and the corresponding product model. The discrete-event simulation system uses all the given information to create a proposal for the construction schedule automatically, which may then be refined using standard scheduling software.",

The field of production planning and control (PPC) and the sustainable optimization of its methods are hereby of utmost importance. This paper introduces a concept for a cognitive production planning and control system, in which so-called smart products store knowledge about the production process and its current state. The RFID (radio frequency identification) technology presents a promising approach to realize those smart products, to enhance the information management on the shop floor and to offer a precise image of individual product states in the production process. The knowledge on production sequences is represented in a graph-based model. The developed concept represents the executable production of every single resource in capability profiles that are used for the allocation of production steps to resources. Material transports are realized by an anticipatory transport control, which updates its model parameters autonomously. During runtime, the product-specific operation times are measured and stored on the smart product, which is subsequently used to update the overall planning data. Thus, the introduced production planning and control system is able to react to unforeseen events (e.g. missing material, insufficient product quality) and autonomously adapts the planning data to the actual elapsed values of the real production. First experiments showed promising results for the approach to provide and process information directly on the shop floor: the idleness of resources due to errors was reduced by 41% from 19.4% to 8.0% during a 3h test run. The waiting time of resources caused by missing material can be reduced in specific cases by 17.7%.",

In today's competitive environment, container terminals should improve their service quality, i.e., effective space resource handling and equipment resource scheduling, for their prosperity or even survival. Although intensive researches were attempted on yard crane scheduling, the solutions from these approaches likely reached a local optimum, and thereafter a rational strategy towards global optimum was still lacking. Accordingly, it became an imperative to explore a rational strategy for this purpose. To resolve this problem, a novel dynamic rolling-horizon decision strategy was proposed for yard crane scheduling in this study. Initially, an integer programming model was established to minimize the total task delaying at blocks. Due to the computational scale with regard to the yard crane scheduling problem, a heuristic algorithm, along with a simulation model, was then applied. In this fashion, the simulation model was next investigated to alternate the periods and evaluate the task delaying. Subsequently, a genetic algorithm was employed to optimize the initial solutions generated. Consequently, computational experiments were used to illustrate the proposed strategy for yard crane scheduling and verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.",

Video recordings of earthmoving construction operations provide understandable data that can be used for benchmarking and analyzing their performance. These recordings further support project managers to take corrective actions on performance deviations and in turn improve operational efficiency. Despite these benefits, manual stopwatch studies of previously recorded videos can be labor-intensive, may suffer from biases of the observers, and are impractical after substantial period of observations. This paper presents a new computer vision based algorithm for recognizing single actions of earthmoving construction equipment. This is particularly a challenging task as equipment can be partially occluded in site video streams and usually come in wide variety of sizes and appearances. The scale and pose of the equipment actions can also significantly vary based on the camera configurations. In the proposed method, a video is initially represented as a collection of spatio-temporal visual features by extracting space-time interest points and describing each feature with a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). The algorithm automatically learns the distributions of the spatio-temporal features and action categories using a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. This strategy handles noisy feature points arisen from typical dynamic backgrounds. Given a video sequence captured from a fixed camera, the multi-class SVM classifier recognizes and localizes equipment actions. For the purpose of evaluation, a new video dataset is introduced which contains 859 sequences from excavator and truck actions. This dataset contains large variations of equipment pose and scale, and has varied backgrounds and levels of occlusion. The experimental results with average accuracies of 86.33% and 98.33% show that our supervised method outperforms previous algorithms for excavator and truck action recognition. The results hold the promise for applicability of the proposed method for construction activity analysis.",

To respond this need, we propose a Markov chain model that could quantify the benefits of RFID from reducing equipment shrinkage and staff time of searching for equipment and increasing equipment utilization in hospitals. Using the proposed Markov chain model, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the performance improvement by RFID-enabled equipment tracking in a hospital. Our results demonstrate that an RFID-enabled equipment tracking system could significantly increase equipment utilization.

The usage of ethnography to inform CSCW design constitutes many challenges to systems design. The most significant of these design challenges is the inevitable need for well-established methods for applying the ethnography within CSCW to inform systems design. We have developed an integrative approach based on ethnography and meta-modelling for use in the context of CSCW research and practice.

The problem of semantic consistency of words and the maintenance of users' editing intentions are the two major challenges when resolving those semantic conflicts. Based on WordNet this paper presents an ontology description language-FLoDL and introduces it to describe the global ontology library (GOL) and the individual ontology library (IOL) in collaborative editing. By this means, we reconstruct the architecture of collaborative editing and propose a mixed peer-to-peer structured semantic collaborative editing architecture. Then a new algorithm for inserting operations, from which semantic conflicts are often caused, is designed to solve the problem of semantic consistency of words. Moreover, by adding users' individualized semantic information into their IOL, we provide the users with individualized services and successfully maintain users' editing intensions. Finally, through some detailed experiments, we perform a compared analysis to show that semantic collaborative editing not only keeps smaller clients (less storage space) but also localizes many editing operations and thereby improves the performance of collaborative editing.",

According to the most recent factsheet published by the American Society of Civil Engineers, one of the top five infrastructure concerns of today in the US is the transportation system. The major challenge facing maintenance managers in state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) today is to preserve the road networks at an acceptable level of serviceability subject to the stringent yearly maintenance and rehabilitation (M&R) budgets. Maintenance managers must allocate such limited budgets among competing alternatives. Absence of simpler decision-making tools exacerbates the matter. This paper presents the development and implementation of a simpler, yet useful, network-level pavement maintenance optimization model, which is a Linear Program (LP) subject to budget constraints and the agencies' pavement performance goals in terms of total lane-miles in each pavement condition state. A decision-making tool is developed using Frontline Systems' Risk Solver Platform add-in for Microsoft Office Excel. This decision-making tool can compute the optimal amount of investment for each pavement treatment type in a given funding period. Pavement condition data pertaining to one of the Districts within a state DOT is used to test the model presented herein. Within this context, nine treatment types along with their corresponding unit prices ($/Lane-Mile), five pavement condition states, pavement deterioration rates, network-level pavement performance targets, and available annual maintenance budget for a 15-year planning horizon are defined. The results presented show how an annual highway maintenance budget needs to be allocated or determined to achieve the District's value proposition for various scenarios. Comparing the results of these varying scenarios provides insight on long-term strategies and the impact of target constraints on budget expenditures.",

Implementing such systems is very complex, however. In many companies the results envisioned have not or have only partly been achieved. In the literature many explanations can be found for insufficient or failing implementation efforts. A large part of the problems encountered appears to be human and organisational in nature, while it has been stressed that implementing an enterprise system requires and involves organisational change. Success and failure factors and do's and don'ts, as can be found in the literature, provide necessary, but not sufficient, preconditions for starting an implementation project. The complexity of such a project makes full anticipation and control of potential problems impossible. An organisation needs to be prepared to encounter disturbances and take corresponding actions. Knowledge on the dynamics of enterprise system implementation processes is, however, scarce and scattered. Moreover, to what extent the context in which an enterprise system is implemented influences implementation is not yet fully known. In this article, an approach is presented to gather knowledge on implementation process dynamics. The approach builds on theoretical and practical contributions in search for a structured human and organisational approach. The knowledge gathered has been analysed by means of a comprehensive reference framework. After this step a tool has been developed to support a consultant in assessing the maturity of a company to start an enterprise system implementation project. The knowledge, used directly in the tool, makes it possible to suggest improvement actions sensitive to the situation and context. Through statistical analysis, interesting context differences have been identified, which may also help in further refining the advice. Initial validation results are promising.",

The ideas in the mind of the customer can be represented by higher level concepts. However, the actual shape, color, and cost embodied in the product can only be viewed as lower-level features. In this paper, a model of preference elicitation from customers is proposed to bridge the gap between low-level features and high-level concepts. First, the attributes of customer preferences are classified using preference taxonomies that we develop. These taxonomies are represented using unstructured documents that are directly collected from customer descriptions. Second, the documents or catalogs of design requirements, containing some textual descriptions and survey reports, are then normalized by using an ontology-based semantic representation. Some semantic rules are developed to describe the low-level features of customer preferences to build an ontological knowledge base. Third, customer preferences are mapped to domain ontologies for driving high-level concept generation. A customer preference modeling framework is developed to construct a vector space model to measure the similarity between two preference concept ontologies. Finally, an empirical study is implemented, and five different customer groups are surveyed about the cell phone preferences. The query results are analyzed to deeply understand the validity of concept generation from the customer preferences.",

This is due, in part, to the fact that current computer applications do not recognize that structural design and architectural design are highly interdependent processes, particularly at the early stages. The goal of this research is to assist structural engineers at the conceptual stage with early digital architectural models. This paper presents a geometric modeling framework for facilitating the engineers' interactions with architectural models in order to detect potential structural problems, uncover opportunities, respect constraints, and ultimately synthesize structural solutions interactively with architectural models. It consists of a process model, a representation model and synthesis algorithms to assist the engineer on demand at different stages of the design process. The process model follows a top-down approach for design refinements. The representation model describes the structural system as a hierarchy of entities with architectural counterparts. The algorithms rely on geometric and topologic relationships between entities in the architectural model and a partial structural model to help advance the synthesis process. A prototype system called StAr (Structure-Architecture) implements this framework. A case study illustrates how the framework can be used to support the conceptual structural design process.",

Particularly, Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) methods are important for the detection of aeronautical defects and they can be used for various kinds of material and in different environments. Conventional non-destructive evaluation inspections are done at periodic maintenance checks. Usually, the list of tools used in a maintenance program is simply located in the introduction of manuals, without any precision as regards to their characteristics, except for a short description of the manufacturer and tasks in which they are employed. Improving the identification concepts of the maintenance tools is needed to manage the set of equipments and establish a system of equivalence: it is necessary to have a consistent maintenance conceptualization, flexible enough to fit all current equipment, but also all those likely to be added/used in the future. Our contribution is related to the formal specification of the system of functional equivalences that can facilitate the maintenance activities with means to determine whether a tool can be substituted for another by observing their key parameters in the identified characteristics. Reasoning mechanisms of conceptual graphs constitute the baseline elements to measure the fit or unfit between an equipment model and a maintenance activity model. Graph operations are used for processing answers to a query and this graph-based approach to the search method is in-line with the logical view of information retrieval. The methodology described supports knowledge formalization and capitalization of experienced NDT practitioners. As a result, it enables the selection of a NDT technique and outlines its capabilities with acceptable alternatives.",

The framework is intended to empower domain experts to specify information required by activities in design, engineering, manufacturing, and maintenance processes. The longer-term goal of the framework is to (semi-)automatically derive a data model from product information specified by domain experts. The framework for information specification is named the Product Information Specification (PIS) framework. The linguistic framework categorizes terms ('tokens') required to define product information into six constituents, similar to the parts of speech in grammar, based on abstraction concepts of Knowledge Representation. Syntactic rules for combining these six constituents guarantee the consistency and the analyzability (computability) of the specified product information. A Context-Free Grammar (CFG) has been adopted for analyzing and defining the rules. The applicability and feasibility of the PIS framework has been demonstrated through a research project with the North American precast concrete industry. Examples in this paper are drawn from this project. The major contribution of the PIS framework is that it provides a basis for a knowledge acquisition method that can facilitate domain experts' direct participation in product modeling, can potentially increase the quality of the resultant model and decrease the product modeling time.",

The aim of the ongoing research at Linkoping University is to shift from manual modeling of disposable geometries to Computer Aided Design (CAD) automation by introducing generic high level geometry templates. Instead of repeatedly modeling similar instances of objects, engineers should be able to create more general models that can represent entire classes of objects. The proposed methodology enables utilization of commercial design tools, hence taking industrial feasibility into consideration. The concept of High Level CAD templates (HLCt) will be proposed and discussed as the building blocks of flexible and robust CAD models, which in turn enables high fidelity geometry in the MDO loop. Furthermore, quantification of the terms flexibility and robustness are presented, providing a means to measure the quality of the geometry models. Finally, application examples are presented in which the outlined framework is evaluated. The applications have been chosen from three ongoing research projects aimed at automating the design of transport aircraft, industrial robots, and micro air vehicles.",

Frequently engineers have neither the time nor inclination to sift through long documents for small pieces of useful information. Yet it is frequently in the form of one or more long documents that the information that they seek is presented. Supporting the delivery of the right information, in the right for-mat and in the right quantity motivates the search for better ways of handling document sub-components or fragments. Document fragment retrieval can be facilitated using modern computational technologies. This paper proposes a novel framework for information access utilising state-of-the-art computational technologies and introducing the use of multiple document structure views through decomposition schemes. The framework integrates document structure study, mark-up technologies, automated fragment extraction, faceted classification and a document navigation mechanism to achieve the target of retrieval of specific document fragments using precise. complex queries. These disparate elements have been brought together in an exploratory Engineering Document Content Management System (EDCMS). Using this, investigations using representative engineering documents have shown that information users can access and retrieve document content - at fragment level rather than at document level - both through data in a document and document metadata, through different perspectives and at different granularities, and simultaneously across multiple documents as well as within a single document.

Product family modelling schema reported in the literature generally stress the component aspects of a product family and its analysis, with a limited capability to model complex inter-relations between physical components and other required information in different semantic orientations, such as manufacturing, material and marketing wise. To tackle this problem, ontology-based representation has been identified as a promising solution to redesign product platforms especially in a semantically rich environment. However, ontology development in design engineering demands a great deal of time commitment and human effort to process complex information. When a large variety of products are available, particularly in the consumer market, a more efficient method for building a product family ontology with the incorporation of multi-faceted semantic information is therefore highly desirable. In this study, we propose a methodology for building a semantically annotated multi-faceted ontology for product family modelling that is able to automatically suggest semantically-related annotations based on the design and manufacturing repository. The six steps of building such ontology: formation of product family taxonomy; extraction of entities; faceted unit generation and concept identification; facet modelling and semantic annotation; formation of a semantically annotated multi-faceted product family ontology (MFPFO); and ontology validation and evaluation are discussed in detail. Using a family of laptop computers as an illustrative example, we demonstrate how our methodology can be deployed step by step to create a semantically annotated MFPFO. Finally, we briefly discuss future research issues as well as interesting applications that can be further pursued based on the MFPFO developed.",

For the purpose of improving shortcomings of the website, and also to make it much easier for users to access information, the system analyzes user browsing patterns from their access records. This paper concentrates on the operating-efficiency of a website-that is, the efficiency with which a group of users browse a website. By achieving high efficiency, users spend less operating cost to accomplish a desired user goal. Based on user access data, we analyze each user's operating activities as well as their browsing sequences. With this data, we can calculate a measure of the efficiency of the user's browsing sequences. The paper develops an algorithm to accurately calculate this efficiency and to suggest how to increase the efficiency of user operations. This can be achieved in two ways: (i) by adding a new link between two web pages, or (ii) by suggesting to designers to reconsider existing inefficient links so as to allow users to arrive at their target pages more quickly. Using this algorithm, we develop a prototype to prove the concept of efficiency. The implementation is an adaptive website system to automatically change the website architecture according to user browsing activities and to improve website usability from the viewpoint of efficiency.",

The richness of information provided by BIMs has the potential to streamline the design and construction processes by enabling enhanced communication, coordination, automation and analysis. However, there are many challenges in extracting construction-specific information out of BIMs. In most cases, construction practitioners have to manually identify the required information, which is inefficient and prone to error, particularly for complex, large-scale projects. This paper describes the process and methods we have formalized to partially automate the extraction and querying of construction-specific information from a BIM. We describe methods for analyzing a BIM to query for spatial information that is relevant for construction practitioners, and that is typically represented implicitly in a BIM. Our approach integrates ifcXML data and other spatial data to develop a richer model for construction users. We employ custom 2D topological XQuery predicates to answer a variety of spatial queries. The validation results demonstrate that this approach provides a richer representation of construction-specific information compared to existing BIM tools.",

            "abstract": "The 'traditional' construction industry has constantly been challenged to improve its inherent problematic practices. Offsite production (OSP), under the umbrella of modern methods of construction (MMC), has been acknowledged as a means to help improve construction industry performance as well as meet new market demands through the provision of improved, adaptable, and sustainable buildings. However, the deployment of OSP systems, if not managed properly, may adversely affect the end result and be counterproductive. It is therefore imperative that the construction industry stakeholders learn and appreciate the specifics, merits, as well as the risks associated with OSP systems in order to achieve the desired outcomes and consequently improve industry performance. On-the-job-training (OJT) is usually sought to facilitate 'experiential' learning, which is argued to be particularly effective where a great deal of independence is granted to the task performer. However, OJT has been criticised for being expensive, limited, and sometimes devoid of the actual training context. In order to address the problems encountered with OJT, several virtual reality (VR) solutions have been proposed. This paper introduces one such VR solution prototype, in order to provide a risk-free environment for learning without the 'do-or-die' consequences often faced on real construction projects. The proffered solution provides a unique VR environment for practicing new working conditions associated with OSP practices. While the 'scenes' of the VR environment take place on a construction site, the environment predominantly targets professionals, such as project managers, construction managers, architects, designers, suppliers and manufacturers, to allow multidisciplinary learning to occur, and hence overcome 'knowledge silos' or 'knowledge compartmentation'. The VR environment enables unforeseen problems often caused by professionals' decisions, faulty work, and health and safety issues to occur; where the implications of which can be evaluated in respect of time, cost and resources. The VR environment proposed does not aim to resolve problems associated with OSP per se, rather aims to allow 'things to go wrong' and consequently allows users not only to 'experience' the resulting implications but also to reflect on those implications as part of the learning process. This paper discusses and presents the prototype for the first development phase of the VR interactive training environment. While the prototype was tested and validated with domain experts from industry, the research community, and academia from different EU countries, the data used in developing the prototype was constrained to one project in the UK which may limit the generalisability of results.",

However, the conventional approaches mainly operate path planning on 2D drawings or building layouts by simply considering geometric information, while losing abundant semantic information of building components. To address this issue, this paper introduces a new method to cope with path planning for 3D indoor space through an IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) file as input. As a major data exchange standard for Building Information Modeling (BIM), the IFC standard is capable of restoring both geometric information and rich semantic information of building components to support lifecycle data sharing. The method consists of three main steps: (1) extracting both geometric and semantic information of building components defined within the IFC file, (2) discretizing and mapping the extracted information into a planar grid, (3) and finally finding the shortest path based on the mapping for path planning using Fast Marching Method. The paper aims to process different kinds of building components and their corresponding properties to obtain rich semantic information that can enhance applications of path planning. In addition, the IFC-based distributed data sharing and management is implemented for path planning. The paper also presents some experiments to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency and adaptability of the method.

            "abstract": "The straightforward and effective realization of construction projects is heavily dependent upon the planning of the construction process and the response to project modifications during the construction phase. Construction-process planning is one of the most important requirements for a satisfactory result, but it is often not given sufficient consideration. The construction planning usually involves great amount of process steps and is developed by the processing of many project participants. The construction-planning steps range from planning of building design and creation of construction drawings up to the generation of schedules for the realization of the planned building. These steps are often executed without overall coordination and reiteratively. The planning process becomes error prone and thus results in inaccurate schedules. The planned construction process must then be operational adapted at the construction site. These drawbacks are mainly produced during the manual creation of schedules that is based on no current or insufficient information. Moreover, due to the complexity of the planning task in the domain of construction planning the manually generated schedules are often imprecise. Furthermore, schedules are not updated when project conditions change. In such situations, project managers balance the available possibilities and intuitively choose one construction alternative for the realization. During this process many factors are often taken into account insufficiently or not at all. In addition, the project managers are wasting their resources generating new schedules for recurring situations that are similar to already executed projects. In consequence, the project experience becomes personal and is not available for other project participants. To eliminate these drawbacks, a knowledge-based approach for the automatic generation of schedules and their evaluation is presented in this paper using the building information for identification of the scheduling subject. With the support of the system, construction schedules can moreover be re-generated flexibly, each time a project is modified, considering the current execution alternatives. All learned experience is stored within a reasoning system for further reuse. Using a decision-support system, construction alternatives can be evaluated considering all relevant factors and the best alternative for the realization can be proposed.",

In the case of materials such information can only be derived from appearance-based data contained in 2D imagery. Currently, the state-of-the-art texture recognition algorithms which are often used for recognizing materials are very promising (reaching over 95% average accuracy), yet they have mainly been tested in strictly controlled conditions and often do not perform well with images collected from construction sites (dropping to 70% accuracy and lower). In addition, there is no benchmark that validates their performance under real-world construction site conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new vision-based method for material classification from single images taken under unknown viewpoint and site illumination conditions. In the proposed algorithm, material appearance is modeled by a joint probability distribution of responses from a filter bank and principal Hue-Saturation-Value color values and classified using a multiple one-vs.-all @g^2 kernel Support Vector Machine classifier. Classification performance is compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms both in computer vision and AEC communities. For experimental studies, a new database containing 20 typical construction materials with more than 150 images per category is assembled and used for validation. Overall, for material classification an average accuracy of 97.1% for 200x200 pixel image patches are reported. In cases where image patches are smaller, our method can synthetically generate additional pixels and maintain a competitive accuracy to those reported above (90.8% for 30x30 pixel patches). The results show the promise of the applicability of the proposed method and expose the limitations of the state-of-the-art classification algorithms under real world conditions. It further defines a new benchmark that could be used to measure the performance of future algorithms.",

These decision support tools are usually used separately for specific purposes. However, the problems they are trying to tackle are often interrelated. Therefore, in this regard, an evaluation tool which can capture as many operational conditions as possible for different decision problems is necessary. This paper introduces a general simulation platform, named MicroPort, which aims to provide an integrated and flexible modeling system for evaluating the operational capability and efficiency of different designs of seaport container terminals. The software structure of MicroPort comprises three programming layers: (1) the Functions layer; (2) the Applications layer; and (3) the Extensions layer. Different layers are bound by Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Basic functions built in the Functions layer support the Applications layer in which major operation processes can be modeled by an agent-based method. External modules and decision support tools in the Extensions layer then use APIs to adjust the system to produce suitable simulation models for specific purposes.",

Two case studies are introduced, followed by an analysis of results and conclusions. The first case study, based on action research, employs interactive tools to collect the evidence, including interviews, surveys, document review, and feedback on progress. The study uses success criteria from construction projects in the UAE, previously identified by the authors. This case study has revealed an organisational transformation trend, from functional, towards matrix and project structures. These types of change are taking place after the implementation of project electronic communication management systems into the client organisation, and are enhancing chances of project success. The second case study takes into consideration the co-existence of the new modern project electronic communication systems with the other traditional communication media. It has been shown that such an arrangement works both for the strategic benefit of the projects, and the projects stakeholders. In the areas of improvements to schedule and project control, the current research results are in agreement with pertinent published literature and research findings.

However, ''cloud computing'' has made irrelevant both the physical location and internal processes used by machine intelligence. In other words, the Internet encourages functional processes to be treated as 'black boxes' with which users need only be concerned with posing the right question and interpreting the response. The system asking the questions does not need to know how answers are generated, only that they are available in an appropriate time frame. This paper proposes that Crowdsourcing could provide on-line, 'black-box', reasoning capabilities that could far exceed the capabilities of current AI technologies (i.e. genetic algorithms, neural-nets, case-based reasoning) in terms of flexibility and scope. This paper describes how Crowdsourcing has been deployed in three different reasoning scenarios to carry out industrial tasks that involve significant amounts of tacit (e.g. unformalised) knowledge. The first study reports the application of Crowdsourcing to identify canonical view of 3D CAD models. The qualitative results suggest that the anonymous, Internet, workforce have a good comprehension of 3D geometry. Having established this basic competence the second experiment assesses the Crowd's ability to judge the similarity of 3D components. Comparison of the results with published benchmarks shows a high degree of correspondence. Lastly the performance of the Internet labourers is quantified in a 2D nesting task, where their performance is found to be superior to reported computational algorithms. In all these cases results were returned within a couple of hours and the paper concludes that there is potential for broad application of Crowdsourcing to geometric problem solving in CAD/CAM.",

The trajectories provide essential information for assessment of site operations and management strategies. Unfortunately, many such tracking and assessment methods are based on manually generated trajectories, thereby excluding long term and complex scenarios. Automated trajectory extraction is a potential solution, however the automated method must provide reliable trajectory information. This paper evaluates the capability of two sensor technologies to provide accurate trajectory data. The primary system investigated is a vision-based strategy while the secondary system investigated is an Ultra Wideband System (UWB). A robotic total station (RTS) provides the ground truth of a single worker for evaluation of both sensor technologies. For comparison, the visual tracking signal is mapped to three-dimensional world coordinates. The UWB and RTS signals are filtered to remove outliers, and are synchronized with the visual tracking signal. Given the single target tracked by the RTS, both UWB and vision are shown to be feasible when the expected accuracy is 1m. A second investigation seeks to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed visual tracking system for tracking multiple interacting workforce, which relies on machine learning to generate target descriptions. The UWB signals for the personnel provide ground truth to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of the vision-based tracking algorithm. The proposed visual tracking system is reliable and accurate enough to permit automated extraction of trajectory information for analysis purposes, such as would be required for work sampling and productivity assessments.",

In the proposed approach, the human operator remains in the decision loop, at the highest level, and acts on the process. To help operators make decisions, process knowledge is represented with a model whose complexity can be adapted on line to the operation needs at the request of the operator. The model thus helps to focus only on the phenomena that are relevant at a given time. To give the model explanatory capacity, it is represented as a causal directed graph, and allows the representation of temporal phenomena, which is fundamental for dynamic monitoring. A hierarchical representation of the functional properties of the process is proposed. The conception of a hierarchy of causal models with a top-down analysis is discussed. Path algebra is used to construct a higher-level graph on-line at the request of the operator from the most detailed graph, while conserving the semantics of the latter. No intermediate level is defined a priori; only the highest and lowest level graphs are fixed: the others are constructed dynamically. Finally, a study of how graphs can convey information on the dynamics of the process for approximate temporal reasoning that is largely sufficient for supervision purposes is analyzed. An example of a causal graph hierarchy for a nuclear process illustrates the method. As a final point, the use of such causal graphs in advanced industrial supervision tools is considered.",

It is obvious that the existing computer tools in this field need to be extended in order to reach a higher level of performance by adding some intelligent behaviour. This paper discusses a framework for intelligent decision support for structural design analysis using a finite element method. The intelligent environment presented is composed of several knowledge-based modules in order to address some major bottlenecks within the analysis-based design improvement process. The prototypes of four intelligent modules are presented within this context. These are: an intelligent module for supporting some initial decisions within the design analysis process, an intelligent module for finite elements\u2019 selection, an intelligent module for finite element mesh design, and an intelligent module for supporting the results\u2019 interpretation process.

Based on a dynamic and domain-specific knowledge ontology, different types of design rules formalize this knowledge in a graph-based form. An expressive visual language provides a user-friendly, human readable representation. Finally, a consistency analysis tool enables conceptual designs to be checked against this formal conceptual knowledge. In this article, we concentrate on the knowledge specification part. For that, we introduce the concepts and usage of a novel visual language and describe its semantics.

The primary contribution of the presented work is the development and implementation of the Integrated Tracking System algorithm which was implemented in two levels. At the first level, the Integrated Tracking System (ITS) was developed by integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) and Personal Dead Reckoning (PDR) system to ubiquitously track a mobile user, in dynamic environments where GPS coverage may be uncertain. At the second level, the PDR system was integrated with a database of pre-determined known indoor location points in order to correct the accumulated drift error during a mobile user's navigation in an indoor environment. Finally, a hybrid tracking system was developed and implemented by integrating the PDR system with the mobile user's intervention and discernment of the environment. The implementation and the results obtained from validation experiments performed on the aforementioned hybrid tracking systems demonstrate the potential of using hybrid tracking for determining the spatial context of mobile users in ubiquitous context-aware engineering applications.",

Further, the performance of RFID was estimated statistically. In addition, a deployment tool was designed for users to obtain a recommended layout. For a given area, solutions of number and placement of RFID readers are computed fast and robustly. To avoid reader collision which may result in low efficiency of a RFID network, two simplified mechanisms were proposed.

            "abstract": "Modeling the energy performance of existing buildings enables quick identification and reporting of potential areas for building retrofit. However, current modeling practices of using energy simulation tools do not model the energy performance of buildings at their element level. As a result, potential retrofit candidates caused by construction defects and degradations are not represented. Furthermore, due to manual modeling and calibration processes, their application is often time-consuming. Current application of 2D thermography for building diagnostics is also facing several challenges due to a large number of unordered and non-geo-tagged images. To address these limitations, this paper presents a new computer vision-based method for automated 3D energy performance modeling of existing buildings using thermal and digital imagery captured by a single thermal camera. First, using a new image-based 3D reconstruction pipeline which consists of Graphic Processing Unit (GPU)-based Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) algorithms, the geometrical conditions of an existing building is reconstructed in 3D. Next, a 3D thermal point cloud model of the building is generated by using a new 3D thermal modeling algorithm. This algorithm involves a one-time thermal camera calibration, deriving the relative transformation by forming the Epipolar geometry between thermal and digital images, and the MVS algorithm for dense reconstruction. By automatically superimposing the 3D building and thermal point cloud models, 3D spatio-thermal models are formed, which enable the users to visualize, query, and analyze temperatures at the level of 3D points. The underlying algorithms for generating and visualizing the 3D spatio-thermal models and the 3D-registered digital and thermal images are presented in detail. The proposed method is validated for several interior and exterior locations of a typical residential building and an instructional facility. The experimental results show that inexpensive digital and thermal imagery can be converted into ubiquitous reporters of the actual energy performance of existing buildings. The proposed method expedites the modeling process and has the potential to be used as a rapid and robust building diagnostic tool.",

A major problem is that due to the one-of-a-kind character of construction projects a lot of work is needed each time to manually develop a project overall process schedule. However, the total individual process is typically structured in multiple stages containing a number of recurring similar but not equal subprocesses that can be standardized if appropriately generalized to generic reusable process patterns. Moreover not only process patterns, but also many general construction methods and strategies can be standardized and stored in form of configuration rules, which will improve the consistency of modeling and have the potential to improve modeling time too. The paper addresses these issues and presents a new approach that combines the ontology-based process modeling with the rule-based process configuration. The proposed system supports the generation of process schedules for construction projects that could be later used in discrete-event simulation software or workflow programs. The development of a formal high-level model for construction processes and a methodology for using process patterns in the configuration of complex construction tasks are described. The main idea of the proposed approach is the development and use of two separate but interrelated ontologies, one for process patterns and the other for process instances, and their integration with a general-purpose rule-engine. With the help of the configuration strategies, realized by means of hierarchical rule sets, an intelligent solution for quick process configuration can be found.",

Regarding the number of conditions comprised in this definition, a minimal representation of compatibility structure is proposed to ease the use and manipulation of a compatibility structure. The definition of compatibility structure and its minimal representation are inspired by those of preference structure in preference modelling. The similarities and dissimilarities between preference structures and compatibility structures are emphasized. The construction and the characterization of a compatibility structure without incomparability using the proposed definition are provided. In this paper, we also propose a method to evaluate the crisp compatibility relations between two alternatives with respect to attributes/criteria. The compatibility relations are evaluated by investigating the impact that an alternative has on another, and vice-versa with respect to a single attribute/criterion. Future research related to the compatibility structure proposed in this paper is described.",

This paper focuses on the optimal sequencing of a yard crane (or YC for short) for serving a fleet of vehicles for delivery and pickup jobs. The objective is to minimize the average vehicle waiting time. While heuristic algorithms could not guarantee an optimal solution, a conventional mathematical formulation such as mixed integer program would require too much computing time. We present two new algorithms to efficiently compute YC dispatching sequences that are provably optimal within the planning window. The first algorithm is based on the well-known A^* search along with an admissible heuristics. We also incorporate this heuristics into a second backtracking algorithm which uses a prioritized search order to accelerate the computation. Experimental results show that both new algorithms perform very well for realistic YC jobs. Specifically, both are able to find within seconds optimal solutions for heavy workload scenarios with over 2.4x10^1^8 possible dispatching sequences. Moreover, even when the vehicle arrival times are not accurately forecasted, the new algorithms are still robust enough to produce optimal or near-optimal sequences, and they consistently outperform all the other algorithms evaluated.",

            "abstract": "Water distribution system design belongs to a class of large combinatorial non-linear optimization problems, involving complex implicit constraints, such as conservation of mass and energy equations, which are commonly satisfied through the use of hydraulic simulation solvers. Recently, many researchers have shifted the focus from traditional optimization methods to the use of meta-heuristic approaches for handling this complexity. This paper proposes a hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution (DE) method, linked to the hydraulic simulator, EPANET, for minimizing the cost design of water distribution systems. The performance of the proposed PSO-DE algorithm is demonstrated using three well-known benchmark water distribution system problems, the two-loop network, the Hanoi network and the New York Tunnels network. The results are compared to that of standard PSO and previously applied optimization methods. It is found that PSO-DE is a promising method for solving water distribution system design problems as it outperforms standard PSO and other algorithms previously presented in the literature for the three case studies considered.",

Condition assessment aims at describing current condition and estimating remaining service lives of infrastructure network components. This is a predominantly time-based analysis, which can be complemented by the spatial analysis of physical condition data of infrastructure components. More specifically, exploratory spatial data analysis might identify areas with high failure rates and generate local indicators of condition for subsets of pipe segments within the physical network. Such local indicators can be used in cost/benefit analysis for planning capital investments with the advantage of allowing the identification of critical customers within critical regions and therefore better accounting for social costs. This paper aims to provide an approach to spatial data clustering of networked infrastructure failure data, which is presented and demonstrated by applying it to a drinking water pipe breakage dataset. Clusters are, in this paper, the set of break points that occurred in regions that present high breakage density per mile of pipe compared to the pipes in their vicinity. The proposed approach can be framed as density-based data clustering approach, and its output consists of a hierarchical clustering of breaks. The root node of the cluster hierarchy, which contains the set of all break points, is subsequently partitioned into smaller clusters. In this hierarchy, clusters are subdivided to reflect different breakage densities along the network space. Therefore, clusters in the lower level of the hierarchy present more homogeneous breakage rates. The results of the proposed approach are assessed according to their sensitivity to choice of parameters and according to a clustering quality measure. The chosen parameters are shown to provide results that are superior compared to a range of parameter choices, in terms of clustering quality, and also compared to the less important though relevant criteria of the number and size of clusters generated.",

Such various levels of detail can be created in two phases: volumetric feature removal which is achieved through interactive feature recognition on the CAD model, and multi-resolution mesh construction which is based on polygonal simplification. Appropriate representations of the assembly are extracted by direction of access matrix, and then presented to the users participating in collaborative design.

In this paper we propose a step towards improving this situation by providing an automated method based on range imaging for estimating the coarse head orientation of a construction equipment operator. This research utilizes commercially-available low resolution range cameras to measure the continuously changing field-of-view (FOV) of an equipment operator in outdoor construction. This paper presents a methodology to measure so-called dynamic blind spot maps. The dynamic blind spot map is then projected on a known static equipment blind spot map that already exists to each construction vehicle. A robust computational coarse head pose estimation algorithm and results to three different pieces of construction equipment and multiple operators are presented. The developed method has the potential in automatically determining the spaces around vehicles that are currently not in the field-of-view of the vehicle operator thus providing eventually additional means and technology for improving safety in construction.",

The second part includes a qualitative field survey of how VR models can be applied and accepted by professionals in the design and planning process of a large pelletizing plant. Through mainly studying persons who had little or no experience with advanced information technology (IT), we hoped to reveal the attitudes of the average person working at a construction site rather than of an IT expert. In summary, the study shows that the VR models in both projects have been very useful and well accepted by the users.

We present a novel functional description language that increases the expressiveness of this approach, increasing the range both of systems and design analysis tasks for which the approach can be used. The language also allows closer integration of functional modelling into the design process. The language allows a device function to be decomposed either in terms of subsidiary functions or required effects. We discuss the use of such alternative decompositions and propose a logic of functional description that is used to underpin the proposed language. The language has been used in the interpretation of electro-mechanical, hydraulic and fluid transfer systems in the automotive and aerospace industries to support Failure Modes and Effects Analysis, Sneak Circuit Analysis, and Diagnosis design analysis tasks.

However, in case of many projects which consist of diverse activities in limited area, the workspace conflict analysis for reducing interferences caused by labor or equipment work is also an important management factor. In particular, if some activities are constructed adjacent to the overlap period, the workspace for those activities may be conflicting. Workspace conflicts decrease work productivity, and accidents can occur. Therefore, it is desirable that the workspace conflict should be minimized in order to perform efficient work. This paper presents a methodology that generates workspaces using a bounding box model and an algorithm in order to identify schedule and workspace conflict. Additionally, a workspace conflict verification system was developed to analyze the workspace information by integrating algorithms that include the automated generation of workspace models and an automatic check of workspace conflict within a 4D simulator. If a project manager can identify the workspace conflict using the system described, the overlapped activities can be rescheduled to minimize the conflict. A case study of a bridge project has been conducted to evaluate the practical applications and feasibility of the developed system. Therefore, the safety and constructability of a project can be improved by the workspace analysis system.",

Shape discovery deals with evolving randomly generated solutions into useful intermediate solutions. These intermediate solutions are then optimised to suite their environment. In this paper a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to the problem of finding the optimum cross-section of a beam, subject to various loading conditions. Previous work using GAs for this problem has relied heavily on heuristics and domain knowledge that operates directly on the genotype to guide the search. It is sound engineering practice to utilise all available information to reduce design and evaluation times, and encourage the formulation of useful solutions. However, domain design knowledge is not always available. This research attempts to explore the efficiency and effectiveness of a GA, when applied to a difficult design task, without being unnecessarily constrained by preconceptions of how to solve the task. Heavy guidance of a GA potentially stifles innovation, can only be applied to situations where the correct answer is known and limits the generic abilities of the search system. This research demonstrates the ability of the GA to evolve good, near optimal solutions without direct guidance. Performing an unbiased search, using only the evolutionary process to search for good solutions, allows a GA to be applied with a high degree of confidence to situations where a priori knowledge of the optimum solution is unavailable. Advanced two-dimensional genetic operators, in conjunction with a suitably designed fitness function, allow a productive evolutionary search. The initial test case is the evolution of an optimal I-beam cross-section, subject to several load cases, starting with an initial random population. It is shown that the methods developed lead to consistently good solutions, despite the complexity of the process.",
