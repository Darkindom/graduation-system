            "abstract": "This paper explores the relationship between domain scheduling in avirtual machine monitor (VMM) and I/O performance. Traditionally, VMM schedulers have focused on fairly sharing the processor resources among domains while leaving the scheduling of I/O resources as asecondary concern. However, this can resultin poor and/or unpredictable application performance, making virtualization less desirable for applications that require efficient and consistent I/O behavior.   This paper is the first to study the impact of the VMM scheduler on performance using multiple guest domains concurrently running different types of applications. In particular, different combinations of processor-intensive, bandwidth-intensive, andlatency-sensitive applications are run concurrently to quantify the impacts of different scheduler configurations on processor and I/O performance. These applications are evaluated on 11 different scheduler configurations within the Xen VMM. These configurations include a variety of scheduler extensions aimed at improving I/O performance. This cross product of scheduler configurations and application types offers insight into the key problems in VMM scheduling for I/O and motivates future innovation in this area.",

This paper explores how to provide an interesting notion of extensibility by virtualizing the interface between code and data. A virtual value is a special value that supports behavioral intercession. When a primitive operation is applied to a virtual value, it invokes a trap on that virtual value. A virtual value contains multiple traps, each of which is a user-defined function that describes how that operation should behave on that value. This paper formalizes the semantics of virtual values, and shows how they enable the definition of a variety of language extensions, including additional numeric types; delayed evaluation; taint tracking; contracts; revokable membranes; and units of measure.

With virtual machines, researchers found they could make these unwieldy architectures look sufficiently similar to existing platforms to leverage the current operating systems.

To maximize their control, both attackers and defenders have migrated to low-level, operating system code. In this paper, we assume the perspective of the attacker, who is trying to run malicious software and avoid detection. By assuming this perspective, we hope to help defenders understand and defend against the threat posed by a new class of rootkits. We evaluate a new type of malicious software that gains qualitatively more control over a system. This new type of malware, which we call a virtual-machine based rootkit (VMBR), installs a virtual-machine monitor underneath an existing operating system and hoists the original operating system into a virtual machine. Virtual-machine based rootkits are hard to detect and remove because their state cannot be accessed by software running in the target system. Further, VMBRs support general-purpose malicious services by allowing such services to run in a separate operating system that is protected from the target system. We evaluate this new threat by implementing two proof-of-concept VMBRs. We use our proof-of-concept VMBRs to subvert Windows XP and Linux target systems, and we implement four example malicious services using the VMBR platform. Last, we use what we learn from our proof-of-concept VMBRs to explore ways to defend against this new threat. We discuss possible ways to detect and prevent VMBRs, and we implement a defense strategy suitable for protecting systems against this threat.",

The material within an element is fragmented by creating several replicas of the element and assigning a portion of real material to each replica. This results in elements that contain both real material and empty regions. The missing material is contained in another copy (or copies) of this element. Our new virtual node algorithm automatically determines the number of replicas and the assignment of material to each. Moreover, it provides the degrees of freedom required to simulate the partially or fully fragmented material in a fashion consistent with the embedded geometry. This approach enables efficient simulation of complex geometry with a simple mesh, i.e. the geometry need not align itself with element boundaries. It also alleviates many shortcomings of traditional La-grangian simulation techniques for meshes with changing topology. For example, slivers do not require small CFL time step restrictions since they are embedded in well shaped larger elements. To enable robust simulation of embedded geometry, we propose new algorithms for handling rigid body and self collisions. In addition, we present several mechanisms for influencing and controlling fracture with grain boundaries, prescoring, etc. We illustrate our method for both volumetric and thin-shell simulations.",

More specifically, by leveraging a handful of pictures of the target user taken from social media, we show how to create realistic, textured, 3D facial models that undermine the security of widely used face authentication solutions. Our framework makes use of virtual reality (VR) systems, incorporating along the way the ability to perform animations (e.g., raising an eyebrow or smiling) of the facial model, in order to trick liveness detectors into believing that the 3D model is a real human face. The synthetic face of the user is displayed on the screen of the VR device, and as the device rotates and translates in the real world, the 3D face moves accordingly. To an observing face authentication system, the depth and motion cues of the display match what would be expected for a human face. We argue that such VR-based spoofing attacks constitute a fundamentally new class of attacks that point to a serious weaknesses in camera-based authentication systems: Unless they incorporate other sources of verifiable data, systems relying on color image data and camera motion are prone to attacks via virtual realism. To demonstrate the practical nature of this threat, we conduct thorough experiments using an end-to-end implementation of our approach and show how it undermines the security of several face authentication solutions that include both motion-based and liveness detectors.",

Virtual machines often have complex expectations of their runtime environment such as access to a particular network segment or storage system. Similarly, the runtime environment may have complex expectations of a virtual machine's behavior such as compliance with network access control criteria or limits on the type and quantity of network traffic generated by the virtual machine. Today, these diverse requirements are too often specified, communicated and managed with non-portable, site specific, loosely coupled, and out-of-band processes. We propose Virtual Machine Contracts (VMCs), a platform independent way of automating the communication and management of such requirements. We describe how VMCs can be expressed through additions to the Open Virtual Machine Format (OVF) standard and how they can be managed in a uniform way even across environments with heterogeneous elements for enforcement.

In this article we review six web-based methods of customer input as examples of the improved Internet capabilities of communication, conceptualization, and computation. For each method we give examples of user-interfaces, initial applications, and validity tests. We critique the applicability of the methods for use in the various stages of PD and discuss how they complement existing methods.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#For example, during the fuzzy front end of PD the information pump enables customers to interact with each other in a web-based game that provides incentives for truth-telling and thinking hard, thus providing new ways for customers to verbalize the product features that are important to them. Fast polyhedral adaptive conjoint estimation enables PD teams to screen larger numbers of product features inexpensively to identify and measure the importance of the most promising features for further development. Meanwhile, interactive web-based conjoint analysis interfaces are moving this proven set of methods to the web while exploiting new capabilities to present products, features, product use, and marketing elements in streaming multimedia representations. User design exploits the interactivity of the web to enable users to design their own virtual products thus enabling the PD team to understand complex feature interactions and enabling customers to learn their own preferences for new products. These methods can be valuable for identifying opportunities, improving the design and engineering of products, and testing ideas and concepts much earlier in the process when less time and money is at risk. As products move toward pretesting and testing, virtual concept testing on the web enables PD teams to test concepts without actually building the product. Further, by combining virtual concepts and the ability of customers to interact with one another in a stock-market-like game, securities trading of concepts provides a novel way to identify winning concepts.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Prototypes of all six methods are available and have been tested with real products and real customers. These tests demonstrate reliability for web-based conjoint analysis, polyhedral methods, virtual concept testing, and stock-market-like trading; external validity for web-based conjoint analysis and polyhedral methods; and consistency for web-based conjoint analysis versus user design.

We have implemented 4D CAD modeling into our undergraduate Architectural Engineering program. We are also experimenting with the use of immersive virtual reality and have developed a tool that allows construction engineering students to interactively generate a construction sequence for a project in an immersive environment. The results of these educational initiatives were assessed through two experiments. The first experiment assessed the educational value of having students develop 4D CAD models for a building project. The second experiment was a preliminary study to determine the educational value of immersing students in a virtual construction project and allowing them to develop a construction plan for the facility. The results of these experiments suggest that students can understand construction projects and plans much better when advanced visualization tools are used. The conclusions from the immersive virtual reality experiment suggest that students can very quickly gain experience by developing and critiquing construction schedules in a full-scale virtual environment. The students were also very engaged by this type of interactive learning experience. We envision important applications of this type of learning environment to improve construction education through the use of different case study projects. By using virtual reality, we can supplement actual construction site visits with virtual, interactive site experiences. These experiences will allow students to experiment with different construction sequences, temporary facility locations, trade coordination, safety issue identification, and design improvements for constructability.",

I review the evidence for the contention that virtual pornography might harm children, and find that it is, at best, inconclusive. Saying that virtual child pornography does not harm actual children is not to say that it is completely harmless, however. Child pornography, actual or virtual, necessarily eroticizes inequality; in a sexist society it therefore contributes to the subordination of women.",

At the same time, higher levels of immersion and visual fidelity afforded by VR do not necessarily evoke presence or elicit a \u201crealistic\u201d psychological response.

One class of VMMs (called Type II VMMs) builds on the abstractions provided by a host operating system. Type II VMMs are elegant and convenient, but their performance is currently an order of magnitude slower than that achieved when running outside a virtual machine (a standalone system). In this paper, we examine the reasons for this large overhead for Type II VMMs. We find that a few simple extensions to a host operating system can make it a much faster platform for running a VMM. Taking advantage of these extensions reduces virtualization overhead for a Type II VMM to 14-35% overhead, even for workloads that exercise the virtual machine intensively.",

With virtual machines, researchers found they could make these unwieldy architectures look sufficiently similar to existing platforms to leverage the current operating systems.

An OS compromise gives the attacker complete access to all of an application's data, regardless of how well the application is built. We propose a new system, Virtual Ghost, that protects applications from a compromised or even hostile OS. Virtual Ghost is the first system to do so by combining compiler instrumentation and run-time checks on operating system code, which it uses to create ghost memory that the operating system cannot read or write. Virtual Ghost interposes a thin hardware abstraction layer between the kernel and the hardware that provides a set of operations that the kernel must use to manipulate hardware, and provides a few trusted services for secure applications such as ghost memory management, encryption and signing services, and key management. Unlike previous solutions, Virtual Ghost does not use a higher privilege level than the kernel.   Virtual Ghost performs well compared to previous approaches; it outperforms InkTag on five out of seven of the LMBench microbenchmarks with improvements between 1.3x and 14.3x. For network downloads, Virtual Ghost experiences a 45% reduction in bandwidth at most for small files and nearly no reduction in bandwidth for large files and web traffic. An application we modified to use ghost memory shows a maximum additional overhead of 5% due to the Virtual Ghost protections. We also demonstrate Virtual Ghost's efficacy by showing how it defeats sophisticated rootkit attacks.",

This article describes Vicher, the first known application of virtual reality to chemical engineering education, and some of what has been discovered about virtual reality as an educational tool during Vicher's development. Vicher currently consists of two programs-Vicher I and Vicher II-which deal with the topics of catalyst deactivation and nonisothermal effects in chemical reaction engineering, respectively.

The systematic digital analysis of the extremely fragile En-Gedi scroll (the oldest Pentateuchal scroll in Hebrew outside of the Dead Sea Scrolls) reveals the writing hidden on its untouchable, disintegrating sheets. Our approach for recovering substantial ink-based text from a damaged object results in readable columns at such high quality that serious critical textual analysis can occur.

Coupled with that demand, a new workforce is emerging with the ability to telecommute, posing unique challenges such as time, physical space, and utilization of  human capital. These challenges have underscored the importance of establishing and maintaining trust in all types of teams. Trust is a necessary prerequisite for  achieving high performance with any team, and that condition is intensified in successful virtual teams. This paper will explore the topic of trust as a crucial component of virtual teams and introduce a new model of instructional design that addresses this essential  requirement. First, a brief definition of virtual teams will be provided, followed by a discussion of the two types of trust: cognitive based and affective based. Next,  support for the model will be provided through examining existing theories on trust and virtual teams, confirming that a strong relationship exists between trust,  communication and performance and reveals some of the challenges for building trust and possible solutions. The presentation of data that built the foundation will  be followed by the introduction of a new instructional design model for establishing and maintaining trust in virtual teams and a description of the various phases of  the model. Finally, a brief explanation will be provided of the model\u2019s relevance and application to instructional design.",

            "abstract": "Many fault-tolerant and intrusion-tolerant systems require the ability to execute unsafe programs in a realistic environment without leaving permanent damages. Virtual machine technology meets this requirement perfectly because it provides an execution environment that is both realistic and isolated. In this paper, we introduce an OS level virtual machine architecture for Windows applications called  Feather-weight Virtual Machine  (FVM), under which virtual machines share as many resources of the host machine as possible while still isolated from one another and from the host machine. The key technique behind FVM is  namespace virtualization , which isolates virtual machines by renaming resources at the OS system call interface. Through a copy-on-write scheme, FVM allows multiple virtual machines to physically share resources but logically isolate their resources from each other. A main technical challenge in FVM is how to achieve strong isolation among different virtual machines and the host machine, due to numerous namespaces and interprocess communication mechanisms on Windows. Experimental results demonstrate that FVM is more flexible and scalable, requires less system resource, incurs lower start-up and run-time performance overhead than existing hardware-level virtual machine technologies, and thus makes a compelling building block for security and fault-tolerant applications.",

Both programs specifically address issues of memory related to inhabiting these VR worlds and connect spatial experiences to acts of practices of recognition, recollection, and remembering: Tactical Iraqi is designed to prompt soldiers to remember specific Arabic words and phrases; Virtual Iraq is intended to trigger memories and appropriate coping mechanisms in combat veterans suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. This paper analyzes how the traditional \"method of loci\" or \"art of memory\" from classical rhetoric, which has been updated by Wong and Storkerson as a tool for hypertext theory, can also be applied to 3D graphical worlds with immersive multi-sensory environments. As Certeau argues, however, in his work on the \"rhetoric of walking,\" the architectures of these virtual worlds should properly offer possibilities for tactical resistance in order to be fully inhabited by their users.",

It achieves mobile computing without requiring the user to carry any hardware. VNC provides access to home computing environments from anywhere in the world, on whatever computing infrastructure happens to be available-including, for example, public Web browsing terminals in airports. In addition, VNC allows a single desktop to be accessed from several places simultaneously, thus supporting application sharing in the style of computer supported cooperative work (CSCW). The technology underlying VNC is a simple remote display protocol. It is the simplicity of this protocol that makes VNC so powerful. Unlike other remote display protocols such as the X Window System and Citrix's ICA, the VNC protocol is totally independent of operating system, windowing system, and applications. The VNC system is freely available for download from the ORL Web site at http://www.orl.co.uk/vnc/. We begin the article by summarizing the evolution of VNC from our work on thin client architectures. We then describe the structure of the VNC protocol, and conclude by discussing the ways we use VNC technology now and how it may evolve further as new clients and servers are developed.",

Our attack works by sending to the JVM a Java program that is designed so that almost any memory error in its address space will allow it to take control of the JVM. All conventional Java and .NET virtual machines are vulnerable to this attack. The technique of the attack is broadly applicable against other language-based security schemes such as proof-carrying code. We measured the attack on two commercial Java virtual machines: Sun's and IBM's. We show that a single-bit error in the Java program's data space can be exploited to execute arbitrary code with a probability of about 70%, and multiple-bit errors with a lower probability. Our attack is particularly relevant against smart cards or tamper-resistant computers, where the user has physical access (to the outside of the computer) and can use various means to induce faults; we have successfully used heat. Fortunately, there are some straightforward defenses against this attack.",

One of the most basic interpersonal needs is to \u201cbelong,\u201d to feel that one is a member of a group of others who share similar interests and goals, and to feel that one is a valued (and unique) member of that group (Baumeister & Leary, 1995; Brewer, 1991).

They consume as much as 10% of execution cycles on TLB misses, even using large pages. On the other hand, we find that these workloads use read-write permission on most pages, are provisioned not to swap, and rarely benefit from the full flexibility of page-based virtual memory.   To remove the TLB miss overhead for big-memory workloads, we propose mapping part of a process's linear virtual address space with a  direct segment , while page mapping the rest of the virtual address space. Direct segments use minimal hardware---base, limit and offset registers per core---to map contiguous virtual memory regions directly to contiguous physical memory. They eliminate the possibility of TLB misses for key data structures such as database buffer pools and in-memory key-value stores. Memory mapped by a direct segment may be converted back to paging when needed.   We prototype direct-segment software support for x86-64 in Linux and emulate direct-segment hardware. For our workloads, direct segments eliminate almost all TLB misses and reduce the execution time wasted on TLB misses to less than 0.5%.",

The urban models that we have come to accept during the 20th century need to be revisited, but change, even if welcomed in abstract, is usually met in reality with enormous resistance from the economic and political models that underlie our cities. Some of the most powerful tools for promoting change are those related to conceptualization and visualization. When considering urban plans that aren't just incremental improvements over what already exists, city officials, urban planners and the general public must be able to visualize not just the merits of those plans in isolation, but how they interact with all the infrastructure that already exists. This paper describes one such urban plan that has been under consideration in the city of Uppsala, Sweden, for the past 5 years: a solar-powered Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) system connecting the main train station to the Hospital and the University. The process of discussing the PRT system included the development of a virtual reality simulation of parts of the city. We report on the process and role of this virtual reality simulation.",

The goal is to build virtual worlds capable of embodying the knowledge to be taught: the metaphorical structuring of abstract concepts looks for bodily forms of expression in order to make knowledge accessible to students. The description of a case study aimed at learning scientific categorization serves to explain and implement the process of metaphorical projection.

            "abstract": "Most modern cores perform a highly-associative transaction look aside buffer (TLB) lookup on every memory access. These designs often hide the TLB lookup latency by overlapping it with L1 cache access, but this overlap does not hide the power dissipated by TLB lookups. It can even exacerbate the power dissipation by requiring higher associativity L1 cache. With today's concern for power dissipation, designs could instead adopt a virtual L1 cache, wherein TLB access power is dissipated only after L1 cache misses. Unfortunately, virtual caches have compatibility issues, such as supporting writeable synonyms and x86's physical page table walker.   This work proposes an Opportunistic Virtual Cache (OVC) that exposes virtual caching as a dynamic optimization by allowing some memory blocks to be cached with virtual addresses and others with physical addresses. OVC relies on small OS changes to signal which pages can use virtual caching (e.g., no writeable synonyms), but defaults to physical caching for compatibility. We show OVC's promise with analysis that finds virtual cache problems exist, but are dynamically rare. We change 240 lines in Linux 2.6.28 to enable OVC. On experiments with Parsec and commercial workloads, the resulting system saves 94-99% of TLB lookup energy and nearly 23% of L1 cache dynamic lookup energy.",

The material within an element is fragmented by creating several replicas of the element and assigning a portion of real material to each replica. This results in elements that contain both real material and empty regions. The missing material is contained in another copy (or copies) of this element. Our new virtual node algorithm automatically determines the number of replicas and the assignment of material to each. Moreover, it provides the degrees of freedom required to simulate the partially or fully fragmented material in a fashion consistent with the embedded geometry. This approach enables efficient simulation of complex geometry with a simple mesh, i.e. the geometry need not align itself with element boundaries. It also alleviates many shortcomings of traditional La-grangian simulation techniques for meshes with changing topology. For example, slivers do not require small CFL time step restrictions since they are embedded in well shaped larger elements. To enable robust simulation of embedded geometry, we propose new algorithms for handling rigid body and self collisions. In addition, we present several mechanisms for influencing and controlling fracture with grain boundaries, prescoring, etc. We illustrate our method for both volumetric and thin-shell simulations.",

In an environment in which both resource availability and software requirements evolve rapidly, this disconnect can lead to resource underutilization, user frustration, and much wasted effort spent on bridging the gap between applications and resources. We show here how these issues can be overcome by allowing authorized Grid clients to negotiate the creation of virtual clusters made up of virtual machines configured to suit client requirements for software environment and hardware allocation. We introduce descriptions and methods that allow us to deploy flexibly configured virtual cluster workspaces. We describe their configuration, implementation, and evaluate them in the context of a virtual cluster representing the environment in production use by the Open Science Grid. Our performance evaluation results show that virtual clusters representing current Grid production environments can be deployed and managed efficiently, and thus can provide an acceptable platform for Grid applications.",

Condition order was randomized and counterbalanced. For each of the three treatment conditions, five visual analog pain scores for each treatment condition served as the dependent variables. On 0-10 labeled scales, both patients provided sensory and affective pain ratings, and subjective estimates of time spent thinking about his pain during the procedure. For patient 1, mean pa...",

In this paper, a virtual community is defined as an aggregation of individuals or business partners who interact around a shared interest, where the interaction is at least partially supported and/or mediated by technology and guided by some protocols or norms. The central objective of developing this typology was to develop a classification system that would be useful to researchers from various disciplinary perspectives such that the classification system might be used as a foundation for theory construction. The proposed typology serves its intended purposes and is evaluated against criteria put forth by Hunt (1991). The proposed typology uses establishment type and relationship orientation as the key categorization variables, reconciling problems posed by other researchers who attempt to use attributes as categorization variables. It is simple, pragmatic for practitioners and useful for researchers seeking to develop an understanding of the virtual community phenomenon.",

La causa es troba en els origens de l'arqueologia, que va neixer al segle XVIII, estretament relacionada amb la historia de l'art. En l'era de les noves tecnologies, aquesta concepcio ha esdevingut alhora causa i consequencia: determina les caracteristiques de l'RV des de la disciplina, pero a la vegada es reforcada per les reconstruccions virtuals. Per a constatar la relacio actual entre l'RV i l'arqueologia, comencarem establint una definicio de realitat virtual. Despres farem un breu recorregut historic per a comprendre l'evolucio de l'arqueologia i dels museus. Aixo ens portara a l'analisi d'alguns exemples d'RV als museus, dels quals extraurem conclusions sobre l'us actual de l'RV. Finalment, veurem les possibilitats de l'RV per a la divulgacio de l'arqueologia.   Text complet (PDF)",

Virtual screening uses computer based methods to discover new ligands on the basis of biological structures. Virtual screening is divided into structural based screening (docking) and screening using active compounds as templates (ligand based virtual screening). Ligand based screening techniques mainly focus on comparing molecular similarity analyses of compounds with known and unknown moiety, regardless of the methods of the used algorithm. Docking is a computational tool of structure based drug design to predict protein ligand interaction geometries and binding affinities. In this review we provide an overview of the already used ligand based virtual screening and the docking with various databases, filters, scores and applications in the rece nt research in the pharmaceutical field.",

In this article we review six web-based methods of customer input as examples of the improved Internet capabilities of communication, conceptualization, and computation. For each method we give examples of user-interfaces, initial applications, and validity tests. We critique the applicability of the methods for use in the various stages of PD and discuss how they complement existing methods.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#For example, during the fuzzy front end of PD the information pump enables customers to interact with each other in a web-based game that provides incentives for truth-telling and thinking hard, thus providing new ways for customers to verbalize the product features that are important to them. Fast polyhedral adaptive conjoint estimation enables PD teams to screen larger numbers of product features inexpensively to identify and measure the importance of the most promising features for further development. Meanwhile, interactive web-based conjoint analysis interfaces are moving this proven set of methods to the web while exploiting new capabilities to present products, features, product use, and marketing elements in streaming multimedia representations. User design exploits the interactivity of the web to enable users to design their own virtual products thus enabling the PD team to understand complex feature interactions and enabling customers to learn their own preferences for new products. These methods can be valuable for identifying opportunities, improving the design and engineering of products, and testing ideas and concepts much earlier in the process when less time and money is at risk. As products move toward pretesting and testing, virtual concept testing on the web enables PD teams to test concepts without actually building the product. Further, by combining virtual concepts and the ability of customers to interact with one another in a stock-market-like game, securities trading of concepts provides a novel way to identify winning concepts.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Prototypes of all six methods are available and have been tested with real products and real customers. These tests demonstrate reliability for web-based conjoint analysis, polyhedral methods, virtual concept testing, and stock-market-like trading; external validity for web-based conjoint analysis and polyhedral methods; and consistency for web-based conjoint analysis versus user design. We report on these tests, commercial applications, and other evaluations. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.",

Study 1 examines the prevalence and nature of these message boards, their users, and most commonly discussed topics. Study 2 was intended to explore the correlations between content areas raised for discussion. Both studies were intended to shed light on the role of message boards in spreading information about self-injurious practices and influencing help-seeking behavior. More than 400 self-injury message boards were identified. Most are populated by females who describe themselves as between 12 and 20 years of age. Findings show that online interactions clearly provide essential social support for otherwise isolated adolescents, but they may also normalize and encourage self-injurious behavior and add potentially lethal behaviors to the repertoire of established adolescent self-injurers and those exploring identity options.",

A virtually synchronous environment allows processes to be structured into  process groups , and makes events like broadcasts to the group as an entity, group membership changes, and even migration of an activity from one place to another appear to occur instantaneously \u2014 in other words, synchronously. A major advantage to this approach is that many aspects of a distributed application can be treated independently without compromising correctness. Moreover, user code that is designed as if the system were synchronous can often be executed concurrently. We argue that this approach to building distributed and fault-tolerant software is more straightforward, more flexible, and more likely to yield correct solutions than alternative approaches.",

New product development activities manifest novelty, uncertainty and complexity, presenting an extreme need for learning in the course of the work. We present data from an exploratory study of learning processes in globally dispersed new product development teams. These qualitative data are used to investigate components of team learning previously highlighted in the team learning literature\u2014namely reflection-oriented and action-oriented behaviors\u2014and to examine the boundaries of these learning behaviors. We find that effective virtual teams, like co-located teams, engage in both reflective and action-oriented learning behaviors. However, the virtual context highlights distinct participation strategies in teams\u2019 learning patterns, which aim to leverage deep, specialist knowledge, on one hand, or seek to integrate diverse knowledge, on the other hand. Moreover, our findings suggest that, in the virtual setting, the boundary of team membership is not centrally associated with different learning behaviors and outcomes, as argued in other team learning research. Instead, virtual team learning behaviors are likely to be shaped by boundaries that delimit timely access to relevant knowledge and skill. In conclusion, we discuss implications for future virtual team learning research.",

However, server platforms are still being designed and evaluated based on performance modeling of a single highly parallel application or a set of homogenous work-loads running simultaneously. Since most future datacenters are expected to employ server virtualization, this paper takes a look at the challenges of modeling virtual machine (VM) performance on a datacenter server. Based on vConsolidate (a server virtualization benchmark) and latest multi-core servers, we show that the VM modeling challenge requires addressing three key problems: (a) modeling the contention of visible resources (cores, memory capacity, I/O devices, etc), (b) modeling the contention of invisible resources (shared microarchitecture resources, shared cache, shared memory bandwidth, etc) and (c) modeling overheads of virtual machine monitor (or hypervisor) implementation. We take a first step to addressing this problem by describing a VM performance modeling approach and performing a detailed case study based on the vConsolidate benchmark. We conclude by outlining outstanding problems for future work.",

Off-campus students in an undergraduate course apply technological design concepts for social mechanisms in communication and collaboration to virtual teamwork. Students utilise the themes of conversation, awareness and coordination and document their reflection on their use over the team lifecycle. All functioning teams indicated that these social mechanisms helped to build team trust and commitment. Seventy-two percent of students indicated positive team experience, despite constraints of workload, time pressure, technology tools, distance and uncooperative team members.

This article begins with a brief overview of methods for producing and delivering VR environments that can be accessed by users for a range of clinical health conditions. Interactive digital games and new forms of natural movementbased interface devices are also discussed in the context of the emerging area of exergaming, along with some of the early results from studies of energy expenditure during the use of these systems. While these results suggest that playing currently available active exergames uses significantly more energy than sedentary activities and is equivalent to a brisk walk, these activities do not reach the level of intensity that would match playing the actual sport, nor do they deliver the recommended daily amount of exercise for children. However, these results provide some support for the use of digital exergames using the current state of technology as a complement to, rather than a replacement, for regular exercise. This may change in the future as new advances in novel full-body interaction systems for providing vigorous interaction with digital games are expected to drive the creation of engaging, low-cost interactive game-based applications designed to increase exercise participation in persons at risk for obesity.",

It achieves mobile computing without requiring the user to carry any hardware. VNC provides access to home computing environments from anywhere in the world, on whatever computing infrastructure happens to be available-including, for example, public Web browsing terminals in airports. In addition, VNC allows a single desktop to be accessed from several places simultaneously, thus supporting application sharing in the style of computer supported cooperative work (CSCW). The technology underlying VNC is a simple remote display protocol. It is the simplicity of this protocol that makes VNC so powerful. Unlike other remote display protocols such as the X Window System and Citrix's ICA, the VNC protocol is totally independent of operating system, windowing system, and applications. The VNC system is freely available for download from the ORL Web site at http://www.orl.co.uk/vnc/. We begin the article by summarizing the evolution of VNC from our work on thin client architectures. We then describe the structure of the VNC protocol, and conclude by discussing the ways we use VNC technology now and how it may evolve further as new clients and servers are developed.",

A growing number of such organizations have explored the virtual environment as one means of achieving increased responsiveness. In particular, the use of virtual teams appears to be on the increase. However, the increased use of virtual teams has not been accompanied by concomitant research efforts to understand better the social-psychological contributors to effective virtual teams. In this paper, we use a model of group effectiveness to propose a possible research agenda examining sources of virtual team effectiveness. Although much of this model offers insights relevant to the virtual environment, differences between groups and teams and between co-located and virtual environments suggest that modifications and additions to this model may be necessary. We offer a set of research propositions to advance future research on effective virtual teams beyond anecdote and description. Implications of this research agenda for managers of virtual teams and human resource professionals are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "Third party JavaScripts not only offer much richer features to the web and its applications but also introduce new threats. These scripts cannot be completely trusted and executed with the privileges given to host web sites. Due to incomplete virtualization and lack of tracking all the data flows, all existing approaches without native sandbox support can secure only a subset of third party JavaScripts, and they are vulnerable to attacks encoded in non-standard HTML/-JavaScript (browser quirks) as these approaches will parse third party JavaScripts independently at server side without considering client-side non-standard parsing quirks. At the same time, native sandboxes are vulnerable to attacks based on unknown native JavaScript engine bugs.   In this paper, we propose Virtual Browser, a full browser-level virtualized environment within existing browsers for executing untrusted third party code. Our approach supports more complete JavaScript language features including those hard-to-secure functions, such as  with  and  eval . Since Virtual Browser does not rely on native browser parsing behavior, there is no possibility of attacks being executed through browser quirks. Moreover, given the third-party Javascripts are running in Virtual Browser instead of native browsers, it is harder for the attackers to exploit unknown vulnerabilities in the native JavaScript engine. In our design, we first completely isolate Virtual Browser from the native browser components and then introduce communication by adding data flows carefully examined for security. The evaluation of the Virtual Browser prototype shows that our execution speed is the same as Microsoft Web Sandbox[5], a state of the art runtime web-level sandbox. In addition, Virtual Browser is more secure and supports more complete JavaScript for third party JavaScript development.",

Eligibility criteria included the use of patients diagnosed with PTSD according to DSM-IV, the use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and the use of virtual reality for performing exposure. 10 articles were selected, seven of which showed that VRET produced statistically significant results in comparison to the waiting list.

The majority of the articles used head-mounted display virtual reality (VR) equipment and VR systems specific for the population that was being treated. Dropout rates do not seem to be lower than in traditional exposure treatment. However, there are a few limitations. Because this is a new field of research, there are few studies in the literature. There is also a need to standardize the number of sessions used. The randomized studies were analyzed to assess the quality of the methodology, and important deficiencies were noted, such as the non-use of intent-to- treat-analysis and the absence of description of possible concomitant treatments and comorbidities. Preliminary data suggest that VRET is as efficacious as traditional exposure treatment and can be especially useful in the treatment of patients who are resistant to traditional exposure.",

There are several ways in which VR technology is expected to facilitate learning. One of its unique capabilities is the ability to allow students to visualize abstract concepts, to observe events at atomic or planetary scales, and to visit environments and interact with events that distance, time, or safety factors make unavailable. The types of activities supported by this capability facilitate current educational thinking that students are better able to master, retain, and generalize new knowledge when they are actively involved in constructing that knowledge in a learning-by-doing situation. The potential of VR technology for supporting education is widely recognized.

Dropout rates do not seem to be lower than in traditional exposure treatment. However, there are a few limitations. Because this is a new field of research, there are few studies in the literature. There is also a need to standardize the number of sessions used. The randomized studies were analyzed to assess the quality of the methodology, and important deficiencies were noted, such as the non-use of intent-to- treat-analysis and the absence of description of possible concomitant treatments and comorbidities. Preliminary data suggest that VRET is as efficacious as traditional exposure treatment and can be especially useful in the treatment of patients who are resistant to traditional exposure.",
